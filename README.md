## Quick Start

### Setup

Our package has been tested on Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04). Other OS platforms (MacOS, Windows) are not fully tested, where you may encounter unexpected errors.

```bash
git clone -b v0.0.9 https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow.git
cd LMFlow
conda create -n lmflow python=3.9 -y
conda activate lmflow
conda install mpi4py
pip install -e .
```

> [!TIP]
> We use WandB to track and visualize the training process by default. Before running the training scripts, users may need to log in to WandB using the command: 
>```bash
>wandb login
>```
> For detailed instructions, refer to the [WandB Quickstart Guide](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart/). Step 1 (registration) and Step 2 (login using your WandB API key) should be sufficient to set up your environment.
>
> <details><summary>Disabling wandb</summary>  
>
> One can disable wandb by either:  
>
> 1. Adding environment variable before running the training command.
>
>```bash
>export WANDB_MODE=disabled
>```
>
> 2. OR, specifying the integrations to report the results and logs to. In the training script, add:
>
>```bash
>--report_to none \
>```
>
> </details>

### Prepare Dataset

For sanity check, we provide [a small dataset](./data/wikitext-2-raw-v1/test) for you to test the finetuning process.

To process your own dataset, please refer to our [doc](https://optimalscale.github.io/LMFlow/examples/DATASETS.html).

### Training
LoRA is a parameter-efficient finetuning algorithm and is more efficient than full finetuning.
```sh
bash run_finetune_with_lora.sh
```
Note: Please double-check that you have updated the [training script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow/refs/heads/data-challenge/run_finetune_with_lora.sh) with the correct arguments for your use case.

> [!TIP]
> <details><summary>Merge LoRA Weight</summary>
>
>Merge LoRA weight and the base model into one using:  
>```sh
>bash ./scripts/run_merge_lora.sh \
>  --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B \
>  --lora_model_path output_models/lora \
>  --output_model_path output_models/lora_merged \
>```
