## Quick Start

### Setup

Our package has been fully tested on Linux OS (Ubuntu 20.04). Other OS platforms (MacOS, Windows) are not fully tested.
You may encounter some unexpected errors. You may try it first on a Linux machine or use Google Colab to experience it.
CUDA versions 10.3-11.7 are supported in our stable branch `v0.0.5`. For CUDA versions greater than 11.7, one can use our unstable branch `main` first.

```bash
git clone -b v0.0.5 https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow.git
cd LMFlow
conda create -n lmflow python=3.9 -y
conda activate lmflow
conda install mpi4py
bash install.sh
```

### Prepare Dataset

Please refer to our [doc](https://optimalscale.github.io/LMFlow/examples/DATASETS.html).

### Finetuning (Full)
Full training updates all the parameters to finetune a language model.
Here is an example to finetune a GPT-2 base model
```sh
cd data && ./download.sh alpaca && cd -

./scripts/run_finetune.sh \
  --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
  --dataset_path data/alpaca/train \
  --output_model_path output_models/finetuned_gpt2
```

### Finetuning (LoRA)
LoRA is a parameter-efficient finetuning algorithm and is more efficient than full finetuning.
```sh
cd data && ./download.sh alpaca && cd -

# Saves lora only
./scripts/run_finetune_with_lora.sh \
  --model_name_or_path facebook/galactica-1.3b \
  --dataset_path data/alpaca/train \
  --output_lora_path output_models/finetuned_galactica_lora

# Saves lora and merges into original model
./scripts/run_finetune_with_lora_save_aggregated_weights.sh \
  --model_name_or_path facebook/galactica-1.3b \
  --dataset_path data/alpaca/train \
  --output_model_path output_models/finetuned_galactica
```

### Inference
After finetuning, you can run the following command to chat with the model.
```sh
./scripts/run_chatbot.sh output_models/finetuned_gpt2
```

### Deployment
If you want to deploy your own model locally, we provide a gradio-based UI for building chatbots. 
Running the following command will launch the demo for robin-7b:

```sh
pip install gradio
python ./examples/chatbot_gradio.py --deepspeed configs/ds_config_chatbot.json --model_name_or_path YOUR-LLAMA  --lora_model_path ./robin-7b --prompt_structure "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human's questions.###Human: {input_text}###Assistant:"       --end_string "#" --max_new_tokens 200
```
We also hosted it on Hugging Face [Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OptimalScale/Robin-7b).


### Evaluation
[LMFlow Benchmark](https://blog.gopenai.com/lmflow-benchmark-an-automatic-evaluation-framework-for-open-source-llms-ef5c6f142418) is an automatic evaluation framework for open-source large language models.
We use negative log likelihood (NLL) as the metric to evaluate different aspects of a language model: chitchat, commonsense reasoning, and instruction following abilities.

You can directly run the LMFlow benchmark evaluation to obtain the results to participate in the
[LLM comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JYh4_pxNzmNA9I0YM2epgRA7VXBIeIGS64gPJBg5NHA/edit?usp=sharing).
For example, to run GPT2 XL, one may execute
```sh
./scripts/run_benchmark.sh --model_name_or_path gpt2-xl
```
`--model_name_or_path` is required, you may fill in huggingface model name or local model path here.

To check the evaluation results, you may check `benchmark.log` in `./output_dir/gpt2-xl_lmflow_chat_nll_eval`,
`./output_dir/gpt2-xl_all_nll_eval` and `./output_dir/gpt2-xl_commonsense_qa_eval`.

## Supported Features

<details> <summary>Finetune Acceleration & Memory Optimization</summary>

* LoRA
  
  LoRA is a parameter-efficient finetuning algorithm and is more efficient than full finetuning. Check out [finetuning-lora](#finetuning-lora) for more details.

* FlashAttention

  LMFlow supports both FlashAttention-1 and the latest FlashAttention-2. Check out [flash_attention](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow/blob/main/readme/flash_attn2.md) for more details.

* Gradient Checkpointing
  
  [Gradient checkpointing](https://github.com/cybertronai/gradient-checkpointing) is a memory optimization technique that trades compute for memory. 
  It is useful when the model is too large to fit into GPU memory. 
  Use it by just adding `--gradient_checkpointing` to your training command.

* Deepspeed Zero3
  
  LMFlow supports [Deepspeed Zero-3 Offload](https://www.deepspeed.ai/2021/03/07/zero3-offload.html). 
  We provide an example [deepspeed config](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow/blob/main/configs/ds_config_zero3.json), and you can directly use it.

<details> <summary>Inference Acceleration</summary>


* LLaMA Inference on CPU

  Thanks to the great efforts of [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). It is possible for everyone to run their LLaMA models on CPU by 4-bit quantization. We provide a script to convert LLaMA LoRA weights to `.pt` files. You only need to use `convert-pth-to-ggml.py` in llama.cpp to perform quantization.

* FlashAttention

  LMFlow supports both FlashAttention-1 and the latest FlashAttention-2. Check out [flash_attention](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow/blob/main/readme/flash_attn2.md) for more details.

<details> <summary>Model Customization</summary>


* Vocabulary Extension

  Now you can train your own sentencepiece tokenizer and merge it with model's origin hf tokenizer. Check out [vocab_extension](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow/blob/main/scripts/vocab_extension) for more details.
