## 1.Setup
```
conda create -n lmflow python=3.9 -y
conda activate lmflow
conda install mpi4py
pip install -e .
```

## 2.Prepare Dataset
You can easily download the example training dataset and test dataset by running 
```bash
cd data
bash download.sh all
cd -
``` 
If you cannot access Google Drive, you can download the data by [BaiduNetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1L7AC5Oy-3YhbCp2aNX4tnQ?pwd=dm2s).

You can also use your own dataset by simply convert to the following format:
```json
{
  "type": "text2text",
  "instances": [
    {
      "input": "Question: The Transformer architecture [START_REF]",
      "output": "N/A"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
```json
{
  "type": "text_only",
  "instances": [
    {
      "text": "Defintion: In this task, we ask you to write an answer to a question that involves events that may be stationary (not changing over time) or transient (changing over time). For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Note that a lot of the questions could have more than one correct answer. We only need a single most-likely answer. Please try to keep your \"answer\" as simple as possible. Concise and simple \"answer\" is preferred over those complex and verbose ones. \n Input: Question: Sentence: It's hail crackled across the comm, and Tara spun to retake her seat at the helm. \nQuestion: Will the hail storm ever end? \n Output: NA \n\n"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
## 3. Run Scripts
### 3.1 Run Finetuning

You can run `scripts/run_finetune.sh` to finetune a GPT-2 base model
```sh
./scripts/run_finetune.sh
```

If you would like to provide arguments for deepspeed to reflect your machine
settings, you may pass the corresponding deepspeed arguments to the script. For
example,
```sh
./scripts/run_finetune.sh "--num_gpus=8 --master_port 10001"
```

To enable LoRA finetuning, you may refer to
```sh
./scripts/run_finetune_with_lora.sh
```
which can be run in similar manner.

For detailed configurations, one may modify these scripts directly. These
scripts actually just call python script `examples/finetune.py`, which can
be run in following manner,

```sh
deepspeed ${deepspeed_args} \
  examples/finetune.py \
    --deepspeed configs/ds_config_zero3.json \
    --bf16 \
    --run_name finetune_with_lora \
    --model_name_or_path facebook/galactica-1.3b \
    --num_train_epochs 0.01 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --dataset_path ${dataset_path} \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 1 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \
    --validation_split_percentage 0 \
    --logging_steps 20 \
    --block_size 512 \
    --do_train \
    --output_dir output_models/finetune \
    --overwrite_output_dir \
    --ddp_timeout 72000 \
    --save_steps 5000 \
    --dataloader_num_workers 1
```
Here we set number of epochs `--num_train_epochs` to `0.01` so that the
finetuning process can be finished quickly. If you wish to obtain a model with
better performance, feel free to adjust those hyperparameters. You may run
```python
python examples/finetune.py -h
```
to view all possible finetuning arguments. The finetuned model checkpoint will
be saved in the argument specified by `--output_dir`, which is
`output_models/finetune` in the above example.
### 3.2 Run Inference

One can directly run inference with an existing huggingface model, e.g. to run
GPT2 large, one may execute
```sh
./scripts/run_inference.sh
```
or run the corresponding python script
```python
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
    deepspeed examples/inference.py \
    --answer_type medmcqa \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2-large \
    --test_file data/MedQA-USMLE/validation/valid_1273.json \
    --deepspeed examples/ds_config.json \
```
To load the finetuned model, specify `--model_name_or_path` with the saved
model checkpoint directory path.

For LoRA finetuned models, one may refer to
```sh
./scripts/run_inference_with_lora.sh
```

Those scripts invoke the examples `examples/*.py` built based on our APIs. For
more API-related examples, one may refer to the methods in the unittest
`tests`.

## 4. Additional Notes
### 4.1 LLaMA Checkpoint

1. First, you need to get the access of LLaMA model from [facebookresearch/llama](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama). Download the official checkpoints and save them into `${llama-path}`.

2. Second, convert the official checkpoints `${llama-path}` to HuggingFace supported checkpoints `${llama-hf-path}` by running

    `python ./scripts/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir ${llama-path} --model_size 7B --output_dir ${llama-hf-path}/llama-7b-hf`

3. Then you are good to go by setting the checkpoint path to `${llama-hf-path}/llama-7b-hf`. Enjoy it!

4. (optional) Now you have the original llama-7b-hf pretrained model. With
```sh
cd output_models && ./download.sh && cd -
```
You can obtain the model difference finetuned by ours. By a way similar to `./scripts/run_inference_with_lora.sh`,
```sh
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
    deepspeed examples/inference.py \
    --answer_type text \
    --model_name_or_path ${llama-hf-path}/llama-7b-hf \
    --lora_model_path output_models/${llama-model-diff-path} \
    --test_file data/alpaca/test/test_252.json \
    --deepspeed examples/ds_config.json
```
You can now inference with the finetuned llama model.

### 4.2 DeepSpeed Config
You can config the deepspeed under configs. Details can be referred at [DeepSpeed Configuration](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/)

## 5. Model Release

### 5.1 Medical Model Checkpoints
You can run following script to download our medical model checkpoints :

```bash
cd output_models
bash download.sh medical_ckpt
cd -
```
You can also directly download our model via google drive link : [medical_ckpt.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bnsQGNGNYchsOfiNyRAmL2fNiowbmFNw/view?usp=share_link)

### 5.2 Instruction Model Checkpoints
Similarly, you can run following script to download our instruction model checkpoints :
```bash
cd output_models
bash download.sh instruction_ckpt
cd -
```

You can also directly download our model via google drive link : [instruction_ckpt.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d_ioQ-ViVweeifbsFSO4pczc3UORFHZO/view?usp=share_link)

### 5.3 Begin Reproduce

After downloading the model checkpoints. You can replace the `--lora_model_path` with `output_models/instruction_ckpt/llama7b-lora` (example for llama-7b for instruction) and replace `--model_name_or_path` with your converted llama model inside `LMFlow/scripts/run_inference_with_lora.sh` and run this shell script to reproduce the result.

Then you can check the model performance at our [Doc](https://optimalscale.github.io/LMFlow/).
