class AdamWScheduleFree(torch.optim.Optimizer):
    r"""
    Schedule-Free AdamW
    As the name suggests, no scheduler is needed with this optimizer. 
    To add warmup, rather than using a learning rate schedule you can just
    set the warmup_steps parameter.
    
    This optimizer requires that .train() and .eval() be called before the
    beginning of training and evaluation respectively. The optimizer should
    also be placed in eval mode when saving checkpoints.
    
    Arguments:
        params (iterable): 
            Iterable of parameters to optimize or dicts defining 
            parameter groups.
        lr (float): 
            Learning rate parameter (default 0.0025)
        betas (Tuple[float, float], optional): coefficients used for computing
            running averages of gradient and its square (default: (0.9, 0.999)).
        eps (float): 
            Term added to the denominator outside of the root operation to 
            improve numerical stability. (default: 1e-8).
        weight_decay (float): 
            Weight decay, i.e. a L2 penalty (default: 0).
        warmup_steps (int): Enables a linear learning rate warmup (default 0).
        r (float): Use polynomial weighting in the average 
            with power r (default 0).
        weight_lr_power (float): During warmup, the weights in the average will
            be equal to lr raised to this power. Set to 0 for no weighting
            (default 2.0).
        foreach (bool): Use a foreach-backed implementation of the optimizer.
            Should be significantly faster, but will have higher peak memory
            usage (default True if supported in your PyTorch version).
