  - question: "In animal cells, which of the following represents the most likely pathway\
      \ that a secretory protein takes as it is synthesized in a cell?\n(A) Plasma\
      \ membrane\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013ribosome\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013rough\
      \ ER (B) Ribosome\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013rough ER\u2013secretory vesicle\u2013\
      plasma membrane (C) Plasma membrane\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013ribosome\u2013\
      secretory vesicle\u2013rough ER (D) Ribosome\u2013rough ER\u2013Golgi apparatus\u2013\
      secretory vesicle\u2013plasma membrane"
    target: Let's think step by step. Protein synthesis starts at the ribosome, so
      we can eliminate (A) and (C). The ribosome is often in the endoplasmic reticulum
      and moves from there to the Golgi apparatus, where it is modified and packaged
      into a vesicle. The vesicle then floats to the plasma membrane and is secreted.
      The answer is (D).
  - question: "A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid\
      \ into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant\
      \ from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019\
      s substrate specificity?\n(A) By changing the enzyme\u2019s pH optimum (B) By\
      \ changing the enzyme\u2019s location in the cell (C) By changing the shape\
      \ of the protein (D) An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter\
      \ the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity."
    target: Let's think step by step. A change in an amino acid leads to a change
      in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may
      lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein.
      A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein,
      so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of
      the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. The
      answer is (C).
  - question: 'Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?

      (A) Translation (B) Conjugation (C) Specialized transduction (D) Transformation'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. The introduction of foreign DNA or RNA into
      bacteria or eukaryotic cells is a common technique in molecular biology and
      scientific research. There are multiple ways foreign DNA can be introduced into
      cells including transformation, transduction, conjugation, and transfection.
      In contrast, (A) is not a way to form DNA: during translation the ribosomes
      synthesize proteins from RNA. The answer is (A).'
  - question: 'Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural
      selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT

      (A) the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat (B) the flippers of a whale and
      the arms of a man (C) the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a
      seal (D) the forelegs of an insect and the forelimbs of a dog'
    target: "Let's think step by step. \u200B\u200BHomologous structures are similar\
      \ physical features in organisms that share a common ancestor \u200B\u200Bbut\
      \ different functions. Comparisons (B) and (C) are clearly homologous because\
      \ they share a common ancestor and the structures serve different purposes.\
      \ Bat wings and birg wings are also homologous, while they are both wings, the\
      \ forelimbs serve different purposes. Insects and dogs are very far ancestors\
      \ since one is vertebrate while the other is invertebrate and the forelimbs\
      \ serve the same purpose, so they are not homologous. The answer is (D)."
  - question: 'Which of the following is not known to be involved in the control of cell
      division?

      (A) Cyclins (B) Protein kinases (C) Checkpoints (D) Fibroblast cells'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. Normal cells move through the cell cycle in
      a regulated way. At the checkpoint stage, they use information about their own
      internal state and cues from the environment around them to decide whether to
      proceed with cell division. Cues like these act by changing the activity of
      core cell cycle regulators inside the cell. The most common regulators are cyclins
      and cyclin-dependent kinases. Fibroblast cells do not play any role in cell
      division. The answer is (D).'
