  - question: 'What is the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus?

      (A) under 650 cc (B) about 800 cc (C) just under 1000 cc (D) 1200 cc'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory
      for help. The average cranium capacity of Homo erectus is less than 1000 cubic
      cm. The answer is (C).
  - question: 'According to Timothy Pauketat, the evidence for social stratification
      and political power at Cahokia suggests:

      (A) a center of Mississippian civilization with conditions similar to the rise
      of early states. (B) the limitations of authority in a Native American society
      of egalitarian foragers. (C) a simple chiefdom or perhaps a complex chiefdom
      had evolved by A.D. 1500. (D) a center of Mississippian civilization with conditions
      similar to societies on the Northwest Coast of North America.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory
      for help. Timothy Pauketat is known for his research on Cahokia, the center
      of the Mississippian culture, where he found similar conditions to the rise
      of early states. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'Recent research on hominid species dating from the Middle Pliocene indicates
      there was (as of 2020):

      (A) a great amount of species diversity, or a single species that exhibited
      a lot of diversity. (B) very little species diversity during this period and
      very few hominids. (C) decreased species diversity due to a prolonged ice age
      followed by a severe drought. (D) decreased species diversity but increased
      numbers of hammerstones and flakes, indicating stone tool manufacture.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory
      for help. Recent research has recognized multiple hominid species from the Middle
      Pliocene, meaning that there is a great amount of species diversity or diversity
      in a single species. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'Researchers now believe that the decline of the Maya was caused chiefly
      by:

      (A) a cataclysm of some kind, such as an earthquake, volcano, or tsunami. (B)
      ecological degradation resulting from slash-and-burn farming techniques. (C)
      endless wars between neighboring Mayan city-states. (D) practices of interbreeding
      that led to a steep rise in congenital disorders.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory
      for help. Researchers believe that the Maya collapse was mainly caused by over-exploitation
      of natural resources like the slash-and-burn farming techniques. The answer
      is (B).
  - question: 'The great Mayan king Pacal built temples in the city of Palenque in order

      away enemies, in particular the Spaniards. (D) legitimize his kingship, since
      his father was not royal.'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on prehistory
      for help. Pacal built the temples as the funerary monument to legitimize his
      kingship. The answer is (D).'
