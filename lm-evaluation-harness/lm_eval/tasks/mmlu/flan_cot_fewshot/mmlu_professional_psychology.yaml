  - question: 'In the construction of a multiple regression equation for purposes of
      prediction, the optimal combination of measures is one in which the predictors

      (A) are uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the
      criterion (B) have low correlations with each other and low correlations with
      the criterion (C) are highly intercorrelated with each other and moderately
      correlated with the criterion (D) have low correlations with the criterion bur
      are moderately correlated with each other'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology
      for help. The basis of multiple regression is to assess the relationship between
      one continuous variable and a set of independent variables. So the predictors
      should be uncorrelated with each other but are moderately correlated with the
      criterion. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'There are three ways to measure the Central Tendency: the Mean, the Median
      and the Mode. From your knowledge about them, what is the mode?

      (A) less sensitive to extreme scores than the mean (B) more useful for skewed
      distributions (C) sensitive to extreme values and highly skewed distributions
      (D) the most frequently occurring number'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology
      for help. The definition of mode is the most frequently occurring number. The
      answer is (D).
  - question: "Carl Jung believed that a client's transference:\n(A) is a fantasy that\
      \ distracts the client from reality. (B) represents \u201Cmixed feelings\u201D\
      \ toward the therapist. (C) \"is a form of \"\"acting out.\"\"\" (D) reflects\
      \ the client\u2019s personal and collective unconscious."
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology
      for help. Transference is a phenomenon that a person's feelings are unconsciously
      redirected, so it reflects the client's personal and collective unconscious.
      The answer is (D).
  - question: "In terms of Hofstede\u2019s (1980) five cultural dimensions, the United\
      \ States scores at the top of the scale on:\n(A) individualism. (B) individualism\
      \ and power distance. (C) power distance and masculinity. (D) uncertainty avoidance."
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology
      for help. US scores highest on individualism among the five cultural dimensions.
      The answer is (A).
  - question: 'One of your therapy clients asks your advice about a good weight- reduction
      program. You have investigated the programs in the community and are enrolled
      in the one you consider the best. This program offers a $50 bonus to its patrons
      for each new person they bring into the program. Under these circumstances,
      your most appropriate response would be to

      (A) tell your client the pros and cons of each program you know about except
      for the one in which you are enrolled (B) recommend to your client the program
      in which you are enrolled and explain the $50 bonus you will receive (C) recommend
      to your client the program in which you are enrolled and offer to have the $50
      bonus credited to your client''s account in the program (D) tell your client
      the pros and cons of each program you know about, but do not claim the $50 bonus
      if your client enrolls in your program'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology
      for help. Based on the circumstances, you should tell your client about the
      pros and cons of each program, but it would be inappropriate to receive the
      bonus, so you should not claim the $50 bonus. The answer is (D).'
