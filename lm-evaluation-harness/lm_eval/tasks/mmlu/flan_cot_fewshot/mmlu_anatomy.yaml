  - question: 'Which of the following is the body cavity that contains the pituitary
      gland?

      (A) Abdominal (B) Cranial (C) Pleural (D) Spinal'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for\
      \ help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. The pituitary gland is the\
      \ major endocrine gland attached to the base of the brain, and it is contained\
      \ in the Cranial cavity. The answer is (B)."
  - question: 'Which of these branches of the trigeminal nerve contain somatic motor
      processes?

      (A) The supraorbital nerve (B) The infraorbital nerve (C) The mental nerve (D)
      None of the above'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for\
      \ help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. \nWe know the following:\
      \ (A) The supraorbital nerve (also known as the frontal nerve) is the largest\
      \ branch of the ophthalmic nerve and branch of ophthalmic division of the trigeminal\
      \ nerve. (B) The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of\
      \ the trigeminal nerve. (C) The mental nerve is a branch of the mandibular division\
      \ of the trigeminal nerve. Because all these nerves are purely sensory nerves\
      \ and do not contain any somatic motor processes. Therefore, the answer should\
      \ be none of the above, which is (D). The answer is (D)."
  - question: 'In Angle''s Class II Div 2 occlusion there is

      (A) excess overbite of the upper lateral incisors. (B) negative overjet of the
      upper central incisors. (C) excess overjet of the upper lateral incisors. (D)
      excess overjet of the upper central incisors.'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for\
      \ help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. This is a question related\
      \ to anatomy and orthodontics. Excess overjet is associated with Class II occlusions;\
      \ therefore, we can safely eliminate (B) from the list, as negative overjet\
      \ is often associated with Class III occlusions. Now, we need to determine the\
      \ location of the excess overjet, and that would be the upper (maxillary) lateral\
      \ incisors. Only (C) has the correct information. The answer is (C)."
  - question: 'The pleura

      (A) have no sensory innervation. (B) are separated by a 2 mm space. (C) extend
      into the neck. (D) are composed of respiratory epithelium.'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for\
      \ help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. First, recall that the pleura\
      \ refers to the thin layer of tissue that covers the lungs and lines the interior\
      \ wall of the chest cavity. Now, let\u2019s look at each option:\nOption (A):\
      \ \u201CThe pleura have no sensory innervation.\u201D This information is not\
      \ correct. The pleura do have a sensory innervation.\nOption (B): \u201CThe\
      \ pleura are separated by a 2 mm space.\u201D This information is not correct.\
      \ There is a very thin \u201Cpotential\u201D space between the layers of the\
      \ pleura; however, it is typically filled with serous pleural fluid. \nOption\
      \ (C): \u201CThe pleura extend into the neck.\u201D This information is actuakky\
      \ true. The cervical pleura, also known as the dome of the pleuradome of the\
      \ pleura, lines the extendsiton of the pleural cavity into the neck.\nOption\
      \ (D): \u201CThe pleura are composed of respiratory epithelium.\u201D This information\
      \ is not correct. The pleaura are composed of connective tissue (CT).\nBecause\
      \ (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect, (D) is the only correct answer. The answer\
      \ is (C)."
  - question: 'What is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?

      (A) The first pharyngeal arch (B) The first and second pharyngeal arches (C)
      The second pharyngeal arch (D) The second and third pharyngeal arches'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for\
      \ help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. The hyoid bone, which is\
      \ also known as the hyooid, is a a small U-shaped bone located in the anterior\
      \ neck. In its resting position, it lies between the ase of the mandible and\
      \ the third cervical vertebrae. We know that the second and the third pharyngeal\
      \ arches give rise to the horns of the hyoid bone; therefore, the embryological\
      \ origin of the hyoid bone are the second and the third pharyngeal arches\u2014\
      this information is covered in the last option (D). Therefore, we conclude that\
      \ (D) must be the correct answer. The answer is (D).\n\n"
