  - question: 'Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?

      (A) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar
      system just like the Kuiper belt. (B) The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend
      to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets
      called the Kuiper belt. (C) The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital
      periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar
      system just like the asteroid belt. (D) The Oort cloud; short period comets
      tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.'
    target: Let's think step by step. Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper
      belt, and we know because short period coments tend to be in the plane of the
      solar system, just like the Kuiper belt is. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'You are pushing a truck along a road. Would it be easier to accelerate
      this truck on Mars? Why? (Assume there is no friction)

      (A) It would be harder since the truck is heavier on Mars. (B) It would be easier
      since the truck is lighter on Mars. (C) It would be harder since the truck is
      lighter on Mars. (D) It would be the same no matter where you are.'
    target: "Let's think step by step. If we assume that there is no friction, the\
      \ force needed to accelerate the truck is by Newton\u2019s second law only dependent\
      \ on the mass of the truck. Hence (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect since it doesn\u2019\
      t matter that it\u2019s on Mars, and (D) is the correct answer. The answer is\
      \ (D)."
  - question: 'Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope
      with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than
      your eye?

      (A) 10000 times more (B) 100 times more (C) 1000 times more (D) 10 times more'
    target: Let's think step by step. The amount of light is proportional to the aperture
      area $A = \pi D^2/4$ for a lens with diameter $D$, so the relative amounts of
      light between the eye with diameter 5mm and the telescope with diameter 50mm
      is $(50 cm)^2/(5mm)^2 = 10000$. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'Why isn''t there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?

      (A) A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.
      (B) There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a
      planet. (C) There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but
      not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet. (D) Resonance with Jupiter
      prevented material from collecting together to form a planet.'
    target: "Let's think step by step. The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting\
      \ of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids\
      \ in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids\
      \ and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there\
      \ are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as\
      \ the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it\u2019s not a lack\
      \ of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect\
      \ because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the\
      \ first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D)."
  - question: 'Why is Mars red?

      (A) Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized ("rusted") minerals.
      (B) Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting
      mostly red light. (C) Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which
      are red in color. (D) Because flowing water on Mars''s surface altered the surface
      minerals several billion years ago.'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red
      color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a
      much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific
      enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct
      because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the
      surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A).
      The answer is (A).'
