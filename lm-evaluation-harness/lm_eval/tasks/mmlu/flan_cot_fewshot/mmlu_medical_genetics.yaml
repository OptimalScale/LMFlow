  - question: 'The stage of meiosis in which chromosomes pair and cross over is:

      (A) prophase I (B) metaphase I (C) prophase II (D) metaphase II'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics
      for help. Prophase I is the stage of meiosis where homologous chromosomes pair
      with each other and exchange genetic material. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'DNA ligase is

      (A) an enzyme that joins fragments in normal DNA replication (B) an enzyme of
      bacterial origin which cuts DNA at defined base sequences (C) an enzyme that
      facilitates transcription of specific genes (D) an enzyme which limits the level
      to which a particular nutrient reaches'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics
      for help. DNA ligase is a type of enzyme (EC 6.5.1.1) responsible for joining
      DNA strands together by catalyzing a phosphodiester bond. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'Which of the following conditions does not show multifactorial inheritance?

      (A) Pyloric stenosis (B) Schizophrenia (C) Spina bifida (neural tube defects)
      (D) Marfan syndrome'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics
      for help. Multifactorial inheritance is when more than a single factor is responsible
      for causing a given trait or health problem. Genes cannot be the only factor.
      Marfan syndrome, on the other hand, requires only one abnormal copy of the of
      the Marfan gene, from one parent, to inherit the trait. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'A gene showing codominance

      (A) has both alleles independently expressed in the heterozygote (B) has one
      allele dominant to the other (C) has alleles tightly linked on the same chromosome
      (D) has alleles expressed at the same time in development'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical genetics
      for help. Codominance, as it relates to genetics, refers to a type of genetic
      inheritance where the phenotype of both the parents is easily observed in the
      offspring. A heterozygote is an individual having two different alleles of a
      gene. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'Large triplet repeat expansions can be detected by:

      (A) polymerase chain reaction. (B) single strand conformational polymorphism
      analysis. (C) Southern blotting. (D) Western blotting.'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical
      genetics for help. A Southern blot is a method in molecular biology for detecting
      specific DNA sequences in a sample. Large triplet repeat expansions are usually
      detected with this method. The answer is (C).'
