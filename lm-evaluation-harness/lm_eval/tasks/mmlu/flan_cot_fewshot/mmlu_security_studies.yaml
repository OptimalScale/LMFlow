  - question: 'What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered
      (as of 2020)?

      (A) Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively
      supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist
      networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor
      states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using
      military force. (B) Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist
      activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still
      managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally
      structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war
      to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous
      population. (C) Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military
      means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime),
      or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease).
      (D) Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism
      has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated
      - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings
      thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative
      crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security\
      \ studies for help. (A) is wrong because it is not competition between larger\
      \ nations that causes terrorism. \n(B) is wrong because globalization is not\
      \ the cause of terrorism.\n(C) is correct because the US undertook the war on\
      \ terrorism. \n(D) is wrong because preventative crime techniques will likely\
      \ not end terrorism. The answer is (C)."
  - question: 'Which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the
      role of child soldiers?

      (A) Child soldiers are victims of combat that need re-education and rehabilitation.
      (B) Children and their mothers are not active subjects in warfare and are best
      considered as subjects in the private sphere. (C) Children are most often innocent
      bystanders in war and are best used as signifiers of peace. (D) Children have
      political subjecthood that is missed when they are considered as passive victims
      of warfare.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies
      for help. Child soliders as a political topic can be missed when they are considered
      passive victims of warfare. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach
      and the concept of human security?

      (A) There are such wide divisions within the human security framework regarding
      the nature of threats and referent objects that no widely applicable comparisons
      between state-centric approaches and human security can be drawn. (B) By adopting
      the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric
      approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as
      the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of
      the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security. (C) The state-centric
      approach to security is a faction of human security, usually defined within
      the broad school of human security. By being state-centric this approach prioritises
      the individual as the referent object in security studies. (D) Both the state-centric
      and human-centric approaches to security are mutually exclusive and offer a
      sufficient analytic framework with which to understand the international security
      system. It is therefore the role of security analysts to determine which of
      these substantial concepts is correct, and which should be discarded.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies
      for help. Human security focuses on a person or population whereas state-centric
      approaches focus on the state while deprioritizing human security. The answer
      is (B).
  - question: 'In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of
      these ways?

      (A) As an existential threat that requires immediate and extraordinary action,
      posing a threat to the survival of the state or to societal security. (B) As
      requiring immediate and extraordinary action by the state, threatening the survival
      of a referent object and therefore warranting the use of measures not normally
      employed in the political realm. (C) As an urgent threat to the survival of
      the referent object, so serious that it legitimises the employment of extraordinary
      action in response. (D) As an urgent threat to the survival of the audience
      that requires extraordinary or emergency measures.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security studies
      for help. To be securitized, a threat must be an urgent threat to the survival
      of the referent object. The answer is (C).
  - question: 'What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?

      (A) Compellence is another term for coercive diplomacy, but covering a narrower
      set of criteria; compellence covers those threats aimed at initiating adversary
      action. A threat to coerce a state to give up part of its territory would count
      as coercive diplomacy, as long as that threat proactively initiates action before
      reactive diplomacy is taken. (B) Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats
      of limited force to induce adversary''s incentive to comply with the coercer''s
      demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance:
      the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element
      of choice with the target to comply, or to continue. (C) Military force, or
      the threat of military force, utilises fear to achieve strategic objectives.
      Coercive diplomacy is differentiated from this approach, because it does not
      use fear as a tool for coercing an adversary. (D) Coercive diplomacy is employed
      to use force but to limit its effects on the international community. Coercive
      diplomacy is an aggressive strategy that is intended to obtain compliance through
      defeat. It does not leave an element of choice with the target, the target either
      being forced to comply or engage in conflict. It seeks to control by imposing
      compliance by removing any opportunity for negotiation or concession.'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on security
      studies for help. Coercive diplomacy uses the threat of force to induce the
      opponent to comply with demands. The answer is (B).'
