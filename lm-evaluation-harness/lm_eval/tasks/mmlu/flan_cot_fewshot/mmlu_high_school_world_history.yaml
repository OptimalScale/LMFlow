  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of\
      \ the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity\
      \ [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be\
      \ made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial\
      \ revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished\
      \ by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole\
      \ continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe\
      \ did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical\
      \ and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \xA9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\n\
      Alfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nThe \"quantum jump\"\

  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The struggle against\
      \ neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world\
      \ from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the\
      \ financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to\
      \ impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many\
      \ other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be\
      \ capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves\
      \ foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance\
      \ with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with\
      \ its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor\
      \ receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in\
      \ the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah,\

  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Indeed, as both\
      \ the fatwas of distinguished [scholars] who base their opinion on reason and\
      \ tradition alike and the consensus of the Sunni community agree that the ancient\
      \ obligation of extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil innovation\
      \ must be the aim of our exalted aspiration, for \"Religious zeal is a victory\
      \ for the Faith of God the Beneficent\"; then, in accordance with the words\
      \ of the Prophet (Peace upon him!) \"Whosoever introduces evil innovation into\
      \ our order must be expelled\" and \"Whosoever does aught against our order\
      \ must be expelled,\" action has become necessary and exigent\u2026\"\nLetter\

      "The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is
      not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be
      healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he
      falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely
      helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize
      any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if
      he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual
      help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large
      cities, where it is very much worse than in the country."
