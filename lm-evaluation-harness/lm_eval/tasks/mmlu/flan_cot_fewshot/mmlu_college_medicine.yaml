  - question: 'An expected side effect of creatine supplementation is:

      (A) muscle weakness. (B) gain in body mass. (C) muscle cramps. (D) loss of electrolytes.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for
      help. Creatine supplementation is a dietary supplement that results in body
      mass gain. The answer is (B).
  - question: 'Which of the following is not a true statement?

      (A) Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate (B)
      Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg
      muscles (C) Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose
      concentration (D) Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine\
      \ for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step and go over each choice: \n(A)\
      \ \u201CMuscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate\u201D\
      : This is a correct statement.\n(B) \u201CElite endurance runners have a high\
      \ proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles\u201D: This is a correct\
      \ statement.\n(C) \u201CLiver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the\
      \ blood glucose concentration\u201D: This is a correct statement. \n(D) \u201C\
      Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body\u201D: This is not\
      \ a correct statement, because insulin promotes glucose uptake by the liver,\
      \ adipose tissue, and muscle, but not all tissues. For instance, the tissues\
      \ in the brain and red blood cells are not affected by insulin. The answer is\
      \ (D)."
  - question: "A high school science teacher fills a 1 liter bottle with pure nitrogen\
      \ and seals the lid. The pressure is 1.70 atm, and the room temperature is 25\xB0\
      C. Which two variables will both increase the pressure of the system, if all\
      \ other variables are held constant?\n(A) Increasing temperature, increasing\
      \ moles of gas (B) Increasing temperature, increasing volume (C) Decreasing\
      \ volume, decreasing temperature (D) Decreasing moles of gas, increasing volume"
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine
      for help. The relevant equation for this is the ideal gas law: PV=nRT. To increase
      the pressure of the system (P), then either n (number of moles of the gas) or
      T (temperature) have to increase. The answer is (A).'
  - question: 'In a genetic test of a newborn, a rare genetic disorder is found that
      has X-linked recessive transmission. Which of the following statements is likely
      true regarding the pedigree of this disorder?

      (A) All descendants on the maternal side will have the disorder. (B) Females
      will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family. (C) All daughters
      of an affected male will be affected. (D) There will be equal distribution of
      males and females affected.'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine\
      \ for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step. Let's recall first that females\
      \ have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. This\
      \ is an important fact we need to know before answering this question. \nBecause\
      \ a male can only pass his only one X chromosome to a daughter, if he is affected\
      \ by this rare genetic disorder, then we know for sure that he will pass this\
      \ rare genetic disorder to all his future-born daughters. Therefore, \u201C\
      (C): All daughters of an affected male will be affected\u201D is a correct statement.\
      \ The answer is (C)."
  - question: 'Glucose is transported into the muscle cell:

      (A) via protein transporters called GLUT4. (B) only in the presence of insulin.
      (C) via hexokinase. (D) via monocarbylic acid transporters.'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine
      for help. Glucose (also known as the blood sugar) is the main sugar found in
      the human body. It is transported into the muscle cell via diffusion through
      protein transporters called GLUT4. The answer is (A).'
