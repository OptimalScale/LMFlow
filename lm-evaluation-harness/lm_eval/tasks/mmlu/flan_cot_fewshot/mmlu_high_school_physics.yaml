  - question: 'A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current
      of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?

      (A) 10 W (B) 30 W (C) 60 W (D) 240 W'
    target: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an
      dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So
      in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).
  - question: "A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required\
      \ to move a charge, Q = +8 \xB5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point\
      \ (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J"
    target: "Let's think step by step. To calculate the work required to move a charge\
      \ from one location to another in a fixed electric field, it is enough to calculate\
      \ the potential difference between the two locations. Here, the potential only\
      \ depends on the distance between the charges; it\u2019s $k q_1 q_2 / r$, where\
      \ $k$ is Coulomb\u2019s constant. Plugging in values $q_1 = $ 1 mC, $q_2 = 8\
      \ \\mu$ C, gives the answer as 5.992 J, which rounds to 6 J. The answer is (B)."
  - question: 'Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is
      conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III.
      Zero net external torque

      (A) I and II only (B) I and III only (C) II and III only (D) III only'
    target: Let's think step by step. Torque is defined as the change in angular momentum;
      if there is zero external torque, angular momentum is conserved. The answer
      is (D).
  - question: "A photocell of work function \u03D5 = 2eV is connected to a resistor in\
      \ series. Light of frequency f = 1 \xD7 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell.\
      \ If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\n\
      (A) 2:00 AM (B) 6:00 AM (C) 12:00 AM (D) 24 A"
    target: Let's think step by step. The only answer above which has units of current
      is D, 24 A. The answer is (D).
  - question: "A pipe full of air is closed at one end. A standing wave is produced in\
      \ the pipe, causing the pipe to sound a note. Which of the following is a correct\
      \ statement about the wave\u2019s properties at the closed end of the pipe?\n\
      (A) The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode.\
      \ (B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a\
      \ node. (C) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes. (D)\
      \ The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes."
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. At the closed end of the pipe, the particles
      cannot have any net displacement because the pipe closure stops them. So the
      particle displacement is at a node. This closure also causes the pressure to
      be maximal, i.e. an antinode. The answer is (B).'
