  - question: "3 Cl\u2212(aq) + 4 CrO_4^2\u2212(aq) + 23 H+(aq) \u2192 3 HClO2(aq) +\
      \ 4 Cr3+(aq) + 10 H2O(l). In the reaction shown above, Cl\u2212(aq) behaves\
      \ as\n(A) an acid (B) a base (C) a catalyst (D) a reducing agent"
    target: Let's think step by step. A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an
      H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as
      an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these
      is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst
      is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself undergoing chemical
      change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C). Instead, the $Cl^{-}
      molecules carry a negative charge, which they donate in the reaction to form
      3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing agent, or (D). The answer is (D).
  - question: 'Which of the following statements about the lanthanide elements is NOT
      true?

      (A) The most common oxidation state for the lanthanide elements is +3. (B) Lanthanide
      complexes often have high coordination numbers (> 6). (C) All of the lanthanide
      elements react with aqueous acid to liberate hydrogen. (D) The atomic radii
      of the lanthanide elements increase across the period from La to Lu.'
    target: Let's think step by step. The atomic radii of the lanthanide elements
      in fact decrease across the period from La to Lu. Options (A), (B), and (C)
      are all true. This means that only (D) is NOT true. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order
      of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?

      (A) PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4 (B) PbH4 < SnH4 < CH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 (C)
      CH4 < SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 (D) CH4 < PbH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < SiH4'
    target: Let's think step by step. The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides decreases
      as we move from the top of group 14 to the bottom. The order of elements in
      the group from top to bottom is C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. Therefore in order of increasing
      thermal stability we have PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, and CH4, or answer (A). The
      answer is (A).
  - question: "Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled\
      \ methyl radical (13CH3\u2022), assuming the lines do not overlap.\n(A) 4 (B)\
      \ 3 (C) 6 (D) 24 (E) 8"
    target: "Let's think step by step. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum\
      \ will be split by two forms of interactions. The first is the hyperfine interaction\
      \ with the 13C (nuclear spin $I = \nrac{1}{2}$) which will split the spectrum\
      \ into 2 lines. This will be further split into 4 lines by the interaction with\
      \ three equivalent 1H nuclei. The total number of lines is therefore $2 \\cdot\
      \ 4 = 8$. The answer is (E).\n\n"
