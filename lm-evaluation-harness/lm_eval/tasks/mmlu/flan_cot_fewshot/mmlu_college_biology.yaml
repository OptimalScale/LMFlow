  - question: 'Which of the following represents an accurate statement concerning arthropods?

      (A) They possess an exoskeleton composed primarily of peptidoglycan. (B) They
      possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart. (C) They are members
      of a biologically unsuccessful phylum incapable of exploiting diverse habitats
      and nutrition sources. (D) They lack paired, jointed appendages.'
    target: Let's think step by step. Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma
      membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which
      is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods
      are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages,
      which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an
      open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B).
  - question: 'In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by
      a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg
      equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals
      who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?

      (A) 1/400 (B) 19/400 (C) 20/400 (D) 38/400'
    target: "Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 +\
      \ 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant\
      \ allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and\
      \ $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and\
      \ heterozygous individuals, respectively. \u200BThe frequency of the recessive\
      \ allele (q) is $\\sqrt{\frac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$.\
      \ The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot 0.95\
      \ = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency\
      \ of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 *\
      \ 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400. The answer is (D)."
  - question: 'According to the pressure-flow model of movement of phloem contents, photosynthate
      movement from source to sink is driven by

      (A) an ATP-dependent pressure-flow pump (B) a water-pressure potential gradient
      (C) transpiration (D) apoplastic diffusion'
    target: Let's think step by step. It is a gradient in water pressure that induces
      the movement of phloem content, which refers to answer (B). The mechanism of
      movement does not rely on metabolism, which rules out (A). Transpiration refers
      to the exhalation of water vapor through plant stomata, and is also not related,
      which rules out (C). While the apoplastic pathway is one of two main pathways
      for water transport in plants, it is not central to the pressure flow model,
      which rules out (D). The answer is (B).
  - question: 'Which of the following contain DNA sequences required for the segregation
      of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis?

      (A) Telomeres (B) Centromeres (C) Nucleosomes (D) Spliceosomes'
    target: Let's think step by step. The genetic material in Telomeres is not used,
      which rules out (A). Nucleosomes are the repeating subunit that comprises chromatin
      packed in a cell nucleus, and do not specifically refer to DNA sequences necessary
      for segregating chromosomes in cell division, which rules out (C). A spliceosome
      is a large ribonucleoprotein that removes introns from transcribed pre-mRNA
      rather than governing chromosome segregation. Centromeres are directly responsible
      for segregating chromosomes in cell division. The answer is (B).
  - question: 'The presence of homologous structures in two different organisms, such
      as the humerus in the front limb of a human and a bird, indicates that

      (A) the human and bird are polyphyletic species (B) a human''s and bird''s evolution
      is convergent (C) the human and bird belong to a clade (D) the human and bird
      developed by analogy'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. Polyphyletic species are organisms that are
      grouped due to having similar characteristics but which do not have a common
      ancestor. This is not the case for humans and birds, which rules out (A). Convergent
      evolution refers to the indepdendent development of similar features in different
      species at different periods, which is also not the case for humans and birds,
      which rules out (B). Analogy refers to the superficial resemblance of structures
      that have different origins, which is not the case for the human and bird forearms,
      which rules out (D). Humans and birds do belong to the same clade - a group
      of organisms composed of a common ancestor. The answer is (C).'
