  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\nRead the following\
      \ excerpt.\nThe revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread\
      \ more or less. It was greatly developed under the r\xE9gime of the military\
      \ despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions,\
      \ and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to\
      \ resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred\
      \ by these innovators.\nThe monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them\
      \ by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over\
      \ the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error,\
      \ and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate\
      \ society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil\
      \ realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are,\
      \ fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families,\
      \ to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore\
      \ strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern\

      \ the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy\

      \ of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent,\
      \ but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and\
      \ not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the\

      \ Societies; that gangrene of society.\n\u2014Klemens von Metternich, Political\
      \ Confession of Faith, 1820\nWhich of the following was the greatest cause of\
      \ the fears expressed by Metternich in the document above?\n(A) The ideas of\
      \ personal liberty and nationalism conceived during the Enlightenment resulted\
      \ in radical revolutions that could spread throughout Europe. (B) The conquest\
      \ of Europe by Napoleon led to the creation of new factions and shifted the\
      \ European balance of power. (C) The power of monarchs had grown to the point\
      \ where it needed to be checked by other powers within each nation or domination\
      \ of civilians would occur. (D) The rising and falling economic cycle of the\

      or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth
      belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels
      whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the
      people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors
      or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the
      people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of
      all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,

      [N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe,

      Which of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of
      1651?

      (A) They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas
      trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth
      century. (B) They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy
      as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended. (C) They were rescinded
      during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations
      with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament''s financial support for war. (D)
      They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands,
      which would not end until after American independence.'

  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was\
      \ nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had\
      \ received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous\
      \ Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle\
      \ class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation,\
      \ and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed\
      \ their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\
      \nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his\
      \ old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had\
      \ gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a\
      \ new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone\
      \ to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with\
      \ the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike\
      \ ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken\
      \ place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \xE9tienne,\
      \ directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers\
      \ at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs\
      \ have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live\
      \ without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen;\
      \ you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some\
      \ lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich,\
      \ you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck\
      \ brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything,\
      \ and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be\
      \ bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\xE9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal,\
      \ 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working\
      \ classes that was typically a part of which movement?\n(A) Capitalist (B) Scientific\
      \ (C) Communist (D) Existentialist"

      based on communal ownership and distribution of property and means of production,
      thereby especially benefiting the working classes. The answer is (C).
  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt\

      \ a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the\
      \ right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every\
      \ kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\n\
      The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of\
      \ the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to\
      \ compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not\
      \ only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly\
      \ necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of\
      \ government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and\
      \ of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope\
      \ for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe\
      \ that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring\
      \ to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed\
      \ by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish\
      \ church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own\
      \ mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish,\
      \ Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up\
      \ to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not\
      \ mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have\
      \ the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The\
      \ Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes\
      \ designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of\
