  - question: 'Iverson Jewelers wrote a letter to Miller, ''We have received an exceptionally
      fine self winding Rolox watch which we will sell to you at a very favorable
      price.''

      (A) The letter is an offer to sell (B) A valid offer cannot be made by letter.
      (C) The letter contains a valid offer which will terminate within a reasonable
      time. (D) The letter lacks one of the essential elements of an offer.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence
      for help. An offer shows the intent to enter into a mutually-beneficial contract
      with specific terms. An offer can be made by a letter. While this letter indicates
      the willingness to sell, the lack of specific terms, such as transaction price
      and offer expiration date, makes it an incomplete offer. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'Functions of the law include all but which of the following?

      (A) maximizing individual freedom (B) providing a basis for compromise (C) keeping
      the peace (D) promoting the principles of the free enterprise system'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence
      for help. Laws are fundamentally about helping resolve disputes between individuals,
      and therefore essential for maximizing individual freedom, providing a basis
      for compromise, and keeping the peace. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'The ________ School of jurisprudence postulates that the law is based
      on what is "correct."

      (A) Natural Law (B) Analytical (C) Historical (D) Sociological'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence
      for help. Natural Law School of jurisprudence focuses on the laws of nature,
      and states that the law should be based on ethics, morals, and what is "correct".
      Analytical deals with the law as it already exists, Historical postulates that
      the law was found and not made, and Sociological studies how the law and society
      impact each other. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'Which word best summarizes Weber''s explanation of the development of
      formally rational law?

      (A) Authority. (B) Charisma. (C) Co-operation. (D) Capitalism.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence
      for help. Weber explained the development of formal rationality in laws as how
      the modern society moved from tradition to rationality, where people decide
      actions based less on how they were culturally done and more on expected utilities.
      How rational individuals optimize efficiency of accomplishing tasks for higher
      rewards is a core principle of Capitalism. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'Which position does Rawls claim is the least likely to be adopted by the
      POP (people in the original position)?

      (A) The POP would choose equality above liberty. (B) The POP would opt for the
      ''maximin'' strategy. (C) The POP would opt for the ''difference principle''.
      (D) The POP would reject the ''system of natural liberty.'''
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on jurisprudence
      for help. The POP would opt for the ''maximin'' strategy, opt for the ''difference
      principle'', and reject the ''system of natural liberty'', but the POP would
      not choose equality above liberty, since the POP assume both equal and free
      citizens. The answer is (A).'
