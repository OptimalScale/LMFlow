  - question: 'A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by
      100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification
      of the telescope is

      (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20'
    target: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are
      converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus
      the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the
      focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80
      cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer
      is (A).
  - question: 'The muon decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into
      an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The muon is forbidden
      from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation
      of

      (A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number'
    target: Let's think step by step. Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the
      total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons. If a muon decays into
      an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one
      to two, violating lepton number conservation. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is
      attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional
      area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0
      volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0
      volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to

      (A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V'
    target: Let's think step by step. This is a simple voltage divider problem, where
      the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the
      voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is
      1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by
      100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification
      of the telescope is

      (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20'
    target: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are
      converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus
      the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the
      focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80
      cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer
      is (A).
  - question: 'For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in
      the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?

      (A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases
      internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume
      of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure
      times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the
      internal energy. The answer is (B).'
