  - question: 'Baron admits that the versions of the ticking bomb hypothetical she discusses
      are "stunningly stupid," but she claims this is actually evidence of

      (A) the stupidity of most traditional philosophical examples. (B) a general
      lack of intelligence among people with advanced degrees. (C) the wrongness of
      torture. (D) the readiness on the part of many intelligent people to see torture
      as the best solution to deal with terrorism.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on moral disputes
      for help. The ticking bomb hypothetical poses a problem where many people will
      die to an exploding bomb, if the hypothetical terrorist does not disclose how
      to defuse it. Baron sees this hypothetical as silly, but its prevalence does
      suggest intelligent people, particularly utilitarians, see torture as justifiable
      to save the lives in this scenario. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'A fertilized ovum is also known as

      (A) a zygote. (B) an embryo. (C) a viability. (D) a blastocyst.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on moral disputes
      for help. Once a single sperm penetrates the layers of an egg to form a new
      cell, that cell is called a zygote. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'Pence compares six different cases of reproduction, from natural twinning
      to SCNT. What conclusion does he draw from this comparison?

      (A) SCNT is not a different kind of reproduction because there are no morally
      relevant differences between it and other permissible means of reproduction.
      (B) Because there is a low risk of harm for natural twinning, there will be
      a low risk of harm for SCNT. (C) both A and B (D) neither A nor B'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on moral disputes
      for help. SCNT, known as 'somatic cell nuclear transfer', is a technique in
      which the nucleus of a somatic (body) cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of
      an enucleated egg. This is used in farm animal cloning. Pence may compare this
      to other processes of reproduction, and see little moral separation. The answer
      is (A).
  - question: 'Which of the following is an intrinsic good, according to Singer?

      (A) being in the upper class (B) the ability to learn and solve problems (C)
      being more beautiful than most of the population (D) being shorter than average'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on moral disputes
      for help. Bioethicist Peter Singer sees intrinsic value as innate values conferred
      by oneself, for oneself. Innanimate objects can be beautiful, short, or have
      some valuable criteria, but capabilities are intrinsically good. The answer
      is (B).
  - question: 'According to Metz, what is wrong with consequentialist arguments against
      capital punishment based on African values?

      (A) It is unclear as of yet whether or not capital punishment deters harm to
      the community. (B) It is unclear as of yet whether or not capital punishment
      deters harm to any individuals. (C) Consequentialism is not supported by African
      values. (D) Even though consequentialism is supported by African values, no
      consequentialist arguments framed in terms of African values have been offered.'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on moral disputes
      for help. Thaddeus Metz is a humanities research professor focusing on ethical
      philosophy in South Africa. Metz has written the death penalty is unjustified
      as it treats individuals as incapable of communal relations. It is unclear that
      capital punishment is to the benefit of, or a deterrent of harm to the community.
      The answer is (A).'
