  samples:
  - question: 'The median survival time to AIDS and death was established by following:

      (A) Seroprevalent HIV-infected individuals (B) Seronegatives (C) Seroconverters
      (D) High-risk seronegatives'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for
      help. The median survival time to AIDS and death was established as a result
      of the development of seroconverters. The answer is (C).
  - question: 'Which of the following is a morphological characteristic of the paramyxoviruses.

      (A) Fragile viruses often visualised with RNA spewing from the inside (B) Elongate
      viruses (C) Icosahedral viruses with envelope (D) Very large viruses'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for
      help. Paramyxoviruses are fragile viruses often visualised with RNA spewing
      from the inside. The answer is (A).
  - question: 'The most important goal of a behavioral intervention is:

      (A) Change in behavior (B) Comprehensive coverage (C) Effective use of behavioral
      theory (D) Sustained behavior change'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for
      help. The prim goal of a behavioral intervention is to cause sustained behavior
      change. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'A key factor facilitating the application of nested case-control studies
      from the MACS was:

      (A) Data collection (B) Establishment of a repository of biologic specimens
      (C) Participant interest (D) Administration of the questionnaire by staff'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for
      help. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study's use of nested case-control studies
      was facilitated by the establishment of a repository of biologic specimens.
      The answer is (B).
  - question: 'Why are parvoviruses a highly impactful parasite?

      (A) Because they have no nucleic acid (B) They require a helper virus (C) Only
      replicate in dividing cells (D) Can integrate into host chromosomes'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology
      for help. Paroviruses are highly impactful because they do not have nucleic
      acid. The answer is (A).'
