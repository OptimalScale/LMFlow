  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\nI come not to urge\
      \ personal claims, nor to seek individual benefits; I appear as the advocate\
      \ of those who cannot plead their own cause; I come as the friend of those who\
      \ are deserted, oppressed, and desolate. In the Providence of God, I am the\
      \ voice of the maniac whose piercing cries from the dreary dungeons of your\
      \ jails penetrate not your Halls of Legislation. I am the Hope of the poor crazed\
      \ beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your\
      \ poor-houses. I am the Revelation of hundreds of wailing, suffering creatures,\
      \ hidden in your private dwellings, and in pens and cabins\u2014shut out, cut\
      \ off from all healing influences, from all mind-restoring cares.\u2026 Could\
      \ their melancholy histories be spread before you as revealed to my grieved\
      \ spirit during the last three months, how promptly, how earnestly would you\
      \ search out the most approved means of relief; how trifling, how insignificant,\
      \ by comparison, would appear the sacrifices you are asked to make; how would\
      \ a few dimes and dollars, gathered from each citizen, diminish in value as\
      \ a possession, compared with the certain benefits and vast good to be secured\
      \ for the suffering insane...by the consecration and application of a sufficient\
      \ fund to the construction of a suitable hospital.\u2026\n\u2014Dorothea Dix,\
      \ Memorial Soliciting a State Hospital for the Protection and Cure of the Insane,\n\
      Submitted to the General Assembly of North Carolina, November 1848\nDorothea\
      \ Dix can best be compared to whom?\n(A) Abigail Adams (B) Clara Barton (C)\
      \ Shirley Temple (D) Hillary Clinton"

  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\n\"As our late Conduct\
      \ at the Conestoga Manor and Lancaster have occasioned much Speculation & a\
      \ great diversity of Sentiments in this and neighboring Governments; some vindicating\
      \ & others condemning it; some charitably alleviating the Crime, & others maliciously\
      \ painting it in the most odious & detestable Colours, we think it our duty\
      \ to lay before the Publick, the whole Matter as it appeared, & still appears,\
      \ to us. . . .\n\"If these things are not sufficient to prove an unjustifiable\
      \ Attachment in the Quakers to the Indians Savages, a fixed Resolution to befriend\
      \ them & an utter insensibility to human Distresses, let us consider a few more\
      \ recent Facts. When we found the last Summer that we were likely to get no\
      \ Assistance from the Government, some Volunteers went out at our own Expense,\
      \ determined to drive our Enemies from our Borders; & when we came near to the\
      \ great Island, we understood that a Number of their Warriors had gone out against\
      \ our Frontiers. Upon this we returned and came up with them and fought with\
      \ them at the Munfey Hill where we lost some of our Men & killed some of their\
      \ Warriors & thereby saved our Frontiers from this Story in another Expedition.\
      \ But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined\
      \ their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who\
      \ were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County,\
      \ were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government\
      \ to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered,\
      \ & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n\u2014\"Apology of the Paxton Boys\"\
      \ (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an explanation,\
      \ not an admission of guilt or regret.\nThe sentiments expressed in the explanation\
      \ above reflect which of the ongoing tensions during the colonial period of\
      \ American history?\n(A) Tensions between British policies and the aspirations\
      \ of North American colonists. (B) Tensions between American Indians allied\
      \ with the French and those allied with the British. (C) Tensions between freed\
      \ African Americans and white planters. (D) Tensions between backcountry settlers\
      \ and elites within colonial America."
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on us history
      for help. After the French and Indian War, the Scotch-Irish settlers attacked
      American Indians. After the attacks on the Conestoga, about 250 Paxton Boys
      present their grievances to the Pennsylvania legislature. As mentioned in the
      information, the Paxton Boys cited resentiment at local elites. The answer is
      (D).
  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\nOur leaders talk about\
      \ stopping aggression from the north, but this was a struggle among groups of\
      \ Vietnamese until we intervened. We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from\
      \ Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do\
      \ it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned\
      \ by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel,\
      \ they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American\
      \ forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and\
      \ south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action\
      \ to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt\
      \ or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have\
      \ prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern,\
      \ \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nWhich of the following opinions\
      \ from the 1960s most directly reflects the perspective of George McGovern's\
      \ speech?\n(A) Americans must maximize their technological edge in Vietnam.\
      \ (B) American bombing in Vietnam is step by step leading to progress in the\
      \ war. (C) American bombing in Vietnam is a failure. (D) America must not give\
      \ in to defeatism about the war in Vietnam."
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on us history
      for help. "Stop the bombing" and "Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously
      check the flow of troops to the south" indicate that the perspective of George
      McGovern's speech is that Amerian bombing in Vietnam is a failure. The answer
      is (C).
  - question: "This question refers to the following information.\n\"In the new Code\
      \ of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you\
      \ would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than\
      \ your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands.\
      \ Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention\
      \ is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will\
      \ not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation.\"\
      \nAbigail Adams, in a letter to John Adams, 1776\n\"Special legislation for\
      \ woman has placed us in a most anomalous position. Women invested with the\
      \ rights of citizens in one section\u2014voters, jurors, office-holders\u2014\
      crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married\
      \ woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others,\
      \ her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against\
      \ her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress\
      \ in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on\
      \ account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no\
      \ right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But\
      \ in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any\
      \ part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband.\
      \ In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts;\
      \ in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational\
      \ advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land\
      \ deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed\
      \ there. But the privileges already granted in the several States are by no\
      \ means secure.\"\nSusan B. Anthony, \"Declaration of Rights for Women,\" July\
      \ 4, 1876\nThe sentiments expressed in the second excerpt by Susan B. Anthony\
      \ are most likely in support of\n(A) the Equal Rights Amendment (B) universal\
      \ suffrage (C) states' rights (D) prohibition"
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on us history
      for help. The above information mentioned that women are in an anomalous position
      in terms of legislation. Women's earnings do not belong to themselves, or they
      cannot testify against her husbands. Susan believes women should have equal
      legal rights as men. The answer is (B).
  - question: 'This question refers to the following information.

      "Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state
      is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we
      suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might
      expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting
      that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the
      badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the
      bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and
      irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the
      case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish
      means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same
      prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the
      least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably
      follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with
      the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others."

      Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776

      Which of the following "miseries" alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists
      of the post-Revolutionary era?

      (A) Organized response to Bacon''s Rebellion (B) Federal response to Shays''s
      Rebellion (C) Federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion (D) Federal response
      to Pontiac''s Rebellion'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on us history
      for help. Anti-Federalists do not believe centralized government power, and
      suspect Washington''s military response to Whiskey Rebellion. Bacon''s Rebellion
      and Pontiac''s Rebellion happen before the Revolution and they can be ruled
      out. The answer is (C).'
