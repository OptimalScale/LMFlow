  - question: 'Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?

      (A) HCl (B) H2SO3 (C) SO2 (D) Al(NO3)3'
    target: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived
      by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which
      means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O,
      forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4,
      or sulfuric acid. The answer is (C).
  - question: 'Which of the following is expected to be a polar molecule?

      (A) PCl4F (B) BF3 (C) CO2 (D) Si(CH3)4'
    target: Let's think step by step. A polar molecule is one that has a slightly
      positive charge on one end of the molecule and a slightly negative charge on
      the other end. Boron trifluoride (BF3) has Boron as the center atom and three
      fluorine atoms attached to it; it is trigonal planar and symmetric, so it is
      nonpolar. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has Carbon as the central atom with double bonds
      to two Oxygen atoms - this is also symmetrical and therefore nonpolar. The same
      is the case for tetramethyl silane (SI(CH3)4), which is a Silicon atom surrounded
      by four methyl groups. The structure of PCL4F is that Phosphorus is the central
      atom, attached to four chlorines and one fluorine atom. This is asymmetrical,
      and therefore has a net dipole and is expected to be a polar molecule. The answer
      is (A).
  - question: 'From the solubility rules, which of the following is true?

      (A) All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble (B) All sulfates are soluble
      (C) All hydroxides are soluble (D) All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble'
    target: Let's think step by step. The chlorides, bromides, and iodides of lead,
      silver, and mercury are not soluble in water. This rules out (A). The sulfates
      of lead, barium, and calcium are not soluble in water, which rules out (B).
      The hydroxides of any metal besides sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, and
      barium are insoluble. This rules out (C). Typically ammonium ions indicate a
      soluble ionic substance. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a
      molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500
      L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?

      (A) 3.89 (B) 7.78 (C) 5.78 (D) 2.33'
    target: "Let's think step by step. Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is\
      \ equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $\nrac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}\
      \ = \nrac{10^{-3.89} \\cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is\
      \ $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$\
      \ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (C)."
  - question: 'A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of
      calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of
      a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the
      pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause
      a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added
      before the pH begins to change significantly?

      (A) 0.500 mole (B) 1.00 mole (C) 2.00 mole (D) 3.00 mole'
    target: "Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity\
      \ of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak\
      \ acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O \nightarrow H_{3}O^{+}\
      \ + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added\
      \ strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the\
      \ maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate\
      \ ion, or 2 moles. The answer is (C).\n\n"
