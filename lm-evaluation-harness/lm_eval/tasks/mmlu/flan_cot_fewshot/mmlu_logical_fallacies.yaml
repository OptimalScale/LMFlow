  - question: 'When an arguer causes confusion during refutation because of real or feigned
      lack of an ability to engage in refutation, that arguer may have committed the
      fallacy of

      (A) poor sportsmanship (B) appeal to compassion (C) argument against the person
      (D) ignorance of refutation'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies
      for help. Ignorance of refutation, one of Aristotle's original list of logical
      fallacies in his Organon, is when someone causes confusion in an argument through
      real or feigned inability to engage in refutation, in order to win the argument.
      The answer is (D).
  - question: 'The complex question fallacy consists of

      (A) arguing something is inferior just because it doesn''t do something it was
      never intended to do. (B) including more than one claim in the proposition and
      treating proof for one claim as proof for all the claims. (C) drawing a conclusion
      before examining the evidence, and only considering evidence that supports that
      conclusion. (D) asking a question that includes either an unproven assumption
      or more than one question, thus making a straightforward yes or no answer meaningless.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies
      for help. The complex question fallacy is when someone makes a single yes or
      no answer to a question meaningless, by including either an unproven assumption
      or many questions. The latter is also known as the many questions fallacy. The
      answer is (D).
  - question: 'Arguing that what is true of the parts must be true of the whole is the
      fallacy of...

      (A) Division (B) Composition (C) Appeal to the person (D) Appeal to ignorance'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical fallacies
      for help. Fallacy of composition occurs when someone argues what is true of
      the parts must be true of the whole. The answer is (B).
  - question: 'Which of the following is true of a valid categorical syllogism?

      (A) The minor premise must deny the antecedent (B) The major premise must affirm
      the consequent (C) The middle term must be used in at least one premise in a
      universal or unqualified sense (D) All of the above'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical
      fallacies for help. A valid categorical syllogism must satisfy several conditions:
      (1) the syllogism must have exactly three terms (2) every term of the syllogism
      must be used twice exactly, (3) a term may be used only once in any premise,
      and (4) the middle term must be used in at least one premise in a universal
      or unqualified sense, etc. Only (C) is true. The answer is (C).'
  - question: 'If someone attacks the character of an opposing arguer, instead of responding
      to that opponent''s arguments, the first person has probably committed which
      of the following fallacies?

      (A) tu quoque (B) horse laugh (C) argument against the person (D) ignoratio
      elenchi'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on logical
      fallacies for help. The argument against the person fallacy occurs when someone
      irrelevantly attacks the character of an opposing arguer, instead of addressing
      that opponent''s arguments. The answer is (C).'
