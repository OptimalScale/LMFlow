  - question: "A 22-year-old male marathon runner presents to the office with the complaint\
      \ of right-sided rib pain when he runs long distances. Physical examination\
      \ reveals normal heart and lung findings and an exhalation dysfunction at ribs\_\
      4-5 on the right. Which of the following muscles or muscle groups will be most\
      \ useful in correcting this dysfunction utilizing a direct method?\n(A) anterior\
      \ scalene (B) latissimus dorsi (C) pectoralis minor (D) quadratus lumborum"
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for
      help. Among the options, only pectoralis minor muscle origins from the outer
      surfaces of the 3rd to 5th ribs. The answer is (C).
  - question: "A 36-year-old male presents to the office with a\_3-week\_history of low\
      \ back pain. He denies any recent trauma but says that he climbs in and out\
      \ of his truck numerous times a day for his job. Examination of the patient\
      \ in the prone position reveals a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior\
      \ inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs\
      \ freely on compression. The most likely diagnosis is\n(A) left-on-left sacral\
      \ torsion (B) left-on-right sacral torsion (C) right unilateral sacral flexion\
      \ (D) right-on-right sacral torsion"
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for
      help. The deep sulcus on the left, a posterior ILA on the right, with a negative
      spring test suggests a right-on-right sacral torsion. All other options have
      a deep sulcus on the right. The answer is (D).
  - question: "A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore\
      \ throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the\
      \ headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He\
      \ has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes\
      \ no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature\
      \ 37.4\xB0C (99.4\xB0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure\
      \ 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes.\
      \ Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia\
      \ on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs\
      \ are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause\
      \ of this patient's symptoms?\n(A) Allergic rhinitis (B) Epstein-Barr virus\
      \ (C) Mycoplasma pneumonia (D) Rhinovirus"
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for
      help. The symptoms, especially the headache, suggest that the most likely cause
      is Rhinovirus. Epstein-Barr virus will cause swollen lymph nodes but there is
      no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation suggests it's
      not Mycoplasma pneumonia. The answer is (D).
  - question: 'A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months
      after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a
      decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often
      sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before
      leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before
      she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges
      and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following
      neurotransmitters?

      (A) Dopamine (B) Glutamate (C) Norepinephrine (D) Serotonin'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine for
      help. The patient feels sad and among the options, only Dopamine and Serotonin
      can help increase positive emotions. Serotonin also affects digestion and metabolism,
      which can help the patient's decreased appetite and sleep difficulty. The answer
      is (D).
  - question: "A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior\
      \ to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received\
      \ care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a\
      \ motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and\
      \ CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results\
      \ of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations,\
      \ and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise\
      \ had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure.\
      \ He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed\
      \ elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations.\
      \ The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy.\
      \ Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6\xB0C (97.9\xB0F), pulse 100/min, respirations\
      \ 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no\
      \ significant findings. Initial preoperative preparation should include treatment\
      \ with which of the following?\n(A) Labetalol (B) A loading dose of potassium\
      \ chloride (C) Nifedipine (D) Phenoxybenzamine"
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on medicine
      for help. The symptoms and the adrenal mass suggested pheochromocytoma, and
      the blood pressure indicates hypertension. Phenoxybenzamine is used to treat
      hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma. The answer is (D).'
