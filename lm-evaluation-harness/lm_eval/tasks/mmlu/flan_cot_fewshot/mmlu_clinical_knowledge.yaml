      (A) glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate. (B) glycogen or glucose to fructose. (C)
      glycogen or glucose to pyruvate or lactate. (D) glycogen or glucose to pyruvate

      for help. Glycolysis is the name given to the pathway involving conversion of
      glycogen or glucose to pyruvate or lactate. The answer is (C).
  - question: 'What is the difference between a male and a female catheter?

      (A) Male and female catheters are different colours. (B) Male catheters are
      longer than female catheters. (C) Male catheters are bigger than female catheters.
      (D) Female catheters are longer than male catheters.'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge
      for help. The difference between a male and female catheter is that male catheters
      tend to be longer than female catheters. The answer is (B).
  - question: 'How many attempts should you make to cannulate a patient before passing
      the job on to a senior colleague, according to the medical knowledge of 2020?

      (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge
      for help. According to the medical protocol as of 2020, you should make two
      attempts to cannulate a patient before passing the job on to a more-senior practitioner.
      The answer is (C).
  - question: 'In the assessment of the hand function which of the following is true?

      (A) Abduction of the thumb is supplied by spinal root T2 (B) Opposition of the
      thumb by opponens policis is supplied by spinal root T1 (C) Finger adduction
      is supplied by the median nerve (D) Finger abduction is mediated by the palmar
      interossei'
    target: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge
      for help. Of all the options, it is only true that the opposition of the thumb
      by opponens pollicis is supplied by spinal root T1. The answer is (B).
  - question: 'The energy for all forms of muscle contraction is provided by:

      (A) ATP. (B) ADP. (C) phosphocreatine. (D) oxidative phosphorylation.'
    target: 'Let''s think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical
      knowledge for help. The energy for muscular contraction is provided by ATP (adenosine
      triphosphate), which is the powerhouse of the cell. The answer is (A).'
