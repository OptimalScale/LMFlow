      The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a
      close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate
      of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that
      Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."

      Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or
      invalid?

      The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather
      of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient
      for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is
      an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
