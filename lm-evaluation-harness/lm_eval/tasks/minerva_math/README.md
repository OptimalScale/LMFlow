## Paper
Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving With the MATH Dataset
https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874

Many intellectual endeavors require mathematical problem solving, but this skill remains beyond the capabilities of computers. To measure this ability in machine learning models, we introduce MATH, a new dataset of 12,500 challenging competition mathematics problems. Each problem in MATH has a full step-by-step solution which can be used to teach models to generate answer derivations and explanations.

NOTE: The few-shot and the generated answer extraction is based on the [Minerva](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14858) and exact match equivalence is calculated using the `sympy` library. This requires additional dependencies, which can be installed via the `lm-eval[math]` extra.

#### Groups

#### Tasks

- `minerva_math_intermediate_algebra`
- `minerva_math_num_theory`

### Checklist

The checklist is the following:

For adding novel benchmarks/datasets to the library:
* [x] Is the task an existing benchmark in the literature?
  * [x] Have you referenced the original paper that introduced the task?
  * [x] If yes, does the original paper provide a reference implementation? If so, have you checked against the reference implementation and documented how to run such a test?
    * The implementation in the original paper is one where the model is first fine-tuned on the data. They do have a few-shot evaluation for GPT-3, however the few-shot context used here is sourced from [Lewkowycz et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14858). The achieved accuracy on Llama-2 models is comparable to that provided in the paper, though not identical.


If other tasks on this dataset are already supported:
* [x] Is the "Main" variant of this task clearly denoted?
* [x] Have you provided a short sentence in a README on what each new variant adds / evaluates?
* [x] Have you noted which, if any, published evaluation setups are matched by this variant?

### Variant Wishlist
