## Latest News 📣

- [2025/03] Added support for steering HF models!
- [2025/02] Added [SGLang](https://docs.sglang.ai/) support!
- [2024/09] We are prototyping allowing users of LM Evaluation Harness to create and evaluate on text+image multimodal input, text output tasks, and have just added the `hf-multimodal` and `vllm-vlm` model types and `mmmu` task as a prototype feature. We welcome users to try out this in-progress feature and stress-test it for themselves, and suggest they check out [`lmms-eval`](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval), a wonderful project originally forking off of the lm-evaluation-harness, for a broader range of multimodal tasks, models, and features.
- [2024/07] [API model](docs/API_guide.md) support has been updated and refactored, introducing support for batched and async requests, and making it significantly easier to customize and use for your own purposes. **To run Llama 405B, we recommend using VLLM's OpenAI-compliant API to host the model, and use the `local-completions` model type to evaluate the model.**
- [2024/07] New Open LLM Leaderboard tasks have been added ! You can find them under the [leaderboard](lm_eval/tasks/leaderboard/README.md) task group.

## Install

To install the `lm-eval` package from the github repository, run:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness
cd lm-evaluation-harness
pip install -e .
```

We also provide a number of optional dependencies for extended functionality. A detailed table is available at the end of this document.

## Basic Usage

### User Guide

A user guide detailing the full list of supported arguments is provided [here](./docs/interface.md), and on the terminal by calling `lm_eval -h`. Alternatively, you can use `lm-eval` instead of `lm_eval`.

A list of supported tasks (or groupings of tasks) can be viewed with `lm-eval --tasks list`. Task descriptions and links to corresponding subfolders are provided [here](./lm_eval/tasks/README.md).

### Hugging Face `transformers`

To evaluate a model hosted on the [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (e.g. GPT-J-6B) on `hellaswag` you can use the following command (this assumes you are using a CUDA-compatible GPU):

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8
```

Additional arguments can be provided to the model constructor using the `--model_args` flag. Most notably, this supports the common practice of using the `revisions` feature on the Hub to store partially trained checkpoints, or to specify the datatype for running a model:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m,revision=step100000,dtype="float" \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8
```

Models that are loaded via both `transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM` (autoregressive, decoder-only GPT style models) and `transformers.AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` (such as encoder-decoder models like T5) in Huggingface are supported.

Batch size selection can be automated by setting the  ```--batch_size``` flag to ```auto```. This will perform automatic detection of the largest batch size that will fit on your device. On tasks where there is a large difference between the longest and shortest example, it can be helpful to periodically recompute the largest batch size, to gain a further speedup. To do this, append ```:N``` to above flag to automatically recompute the largest batch size ```N``` times. For example, to recompute the batch size 4 times, the command would be:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m,revision=step100000,dtype="float" \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size auto:4
```

> [!Note]
> Just like you can provide a local path to `transformers.AutoModel`, you can also provide a local path to `lm_eval` via `--model_args pretrained=/path/to/model`

#### Multi-GPU Evaluation with Hugging Face `accelerate`

We support three main ways of using Hugging Face's [accelerate 🚀](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) library for multi-GPU evaluation.

To perform *data-parallel evaluation* (where each GPU loads a **separate full copy** of the model), we leverage the `accelerate` launcher as follows:

```bash
accelerate launch -m lm_eval --model hf \
    --tasks lambada_openai,arc_easy \
    --batch_size 16
```

(or via `accelerate launch --no-python lm_eval`).

For cases where your model can fit on a single GPU, this allows you to evaluate on K GPUs K times faster than on one.

**WARNING**: This setup does not work with FSDP model sharding, so in `accelerate config` FSDP must be disabled, or the NO_SHARD FSDP option must be used.

The second way of using `accelerate` for multi-GPU evaluation is when your model is *too large to fit on a single GPU.*

In this setting, run the library *outside the `accelerate` launcher*, but passing `parallelize=True` to `--model_args` as follows:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --tasks lambada_openai,arc_easy \
    --model_args parallelize=True \
    --batch_size 16
```

This means that your model's weights will be split across all available GPUs.

For more advanced users or even larger models, we allow for the following arguments when `parallelize=True` as well:

- `device_map_option`: How to split model weights across available GPUs. defaults to "auto".
- `max_memory_per_gpu`: the max GPU memory to use per GPU in loading the model.
- `max_cpu_memory`: the max amount of CPU memory to use when offloading the model weights to RAM.
- `offload_folder`: a folder where model weights will be offloaded to disk if needed.

The third option is to use both at the same time. This will allow you to take advantage of both data parallelism and model sharding, and is especially useful for models that are too large to fit on a single GPU.

```bash
accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes {nb_of_copies_of_your_model} \
    -m lm_eval --model hf \
    --tasks lambada_openai,arc_easy \
    --model_args parallelize=True \
    --batch_size 16
```

To learn more about model parallelism and how to use it with the `accelerate` library, see the [accelerate documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.15.0/en/parallelism)

**Warning: We do not natively support multi-node evaluation using the `hf` model type! Please reference [our GPT-NeoX library integration](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/eval.py) for an example of code in which a custom multi-machine evaluation script is written.**

**Note: we do not currently support multi-node evaluations natively, and advise using either an externally hosted server to run inference requests against, or creating a custom integration with your distributed framework [as is done for the GPT-NeoX library](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/eval_tasks/eval_adapter.py).**

### Steered Hugging Face `transformers` models

To evaluate a Hugging Face `transformers` model with steering vectors applied, specify the model type as `steered` and provide the path to either a PyTorch file containing pre-defined steering vectors, or a CSV file that specifies how to derive steering vectors from pretrained `sparsify` or `sae_lens` models (you will need to install the corresponding optional dependency for this method).

Specify pre-defined steering vectors:

```python
import torch

steer_config = {
    "layers.3": {
        "steering_vector": torch.randn(1, 768),
        "bias": torch.randn(1, 768),
        "steering_coefficient": 1,
        "action": "add"
    },
}
torch.save(steer_config, "steer_config.pt")
```

Specify derived steering vectors:

```python
import pandas as pd

pd.DataFrame({
    "loader": ["sparsify"],
    "action": ["add"],
    "sparse_model": ["EleutherAI/sae-pythia-70m-32k"],
    "hookpoint": ["layers.3"],
    "feature_index": [30],
    "steering_coefficient": [10.0],
}).to_csv("steer_config.csv", index=False)
```

Run the evaluation harness with steering vectors applied:

```bash
lm_eval --model steered \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/pythia-160m,steer_path=steer_config.pt \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8
```

### NVIDIA `nemo` models

[NVIDIA NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is a generative AI framework built for researchers and pytorch developers working on language models.

To evaluate a `nemo` model, start by installing NeMo following [the documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). We highly recommended to use the NVIDIA PyTorch or NeMo container, especially if having issues installing Apex or any other dependencies (see [latest released containers](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases)). Please also install the lm evaluation harness library following the instructions in [the Install section](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#install).

NeMo models can be obtained through [NVIDIA NGC Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models) or in [NVIDIA's Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/nvidia). In [NVIDIA NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/scripts/nlp_language_modeling) there are conversion scripts to convert the `hf` checkpoints of popular models like llama, falcon, mixtral or mpt to `nemo`.

Run a `nemo` model on one GPU:

```bash
lm_eval --model nemo_lm \
    --model_args path=<path_to_nemo_model> \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --batch_size 32
```

It is recommended to unpack the `nemo` model to avoid the unpacking inside the docker container - it may overflow disk space. For that you can run:

```bash
mkdir MY_MODEL
tar -xvf MY_MODEL.nemo -c MY_MODEL
```

#### Multi-GPU evaluation with NVIDIA `nemo` models

By default, only one GPU is used. But we do support either data replication or tensor/pipeline parallelism during evaluation, on one node.

1) To enable data replication, set the `model_args` of `devices` to the number of data replicas to run. For example, the command to run 8 data replicas over 8 GPUs is:

```bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 --no-python lm_eval \
    --model nemo_lm \
    --model_args path=<path_to_nemo_model>,devices=8 \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --batch_size 32
```

1) To enable tensor and/or pipeline parallelism, set the `model_args` of `tensor_model_parallel_size` and/or `pipeline_model_parallel_size`. In addition, you also have to set up `devices` to be equal to the product of `tensor_model_parallel_size` and/or `pipeline_model_parallel_size`. For example, the command to use one node of 4 GPUs with tensor parallelism of 2 and pipeline parallelism of 2 is:

```bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node=4 --no-python lm_eval \
    --model nemo_lm \
    --model_args path=<path_to_nemo_model>,devices=4,tensor_model_parallel_size=2,pipeline_model_parallel_size=2 \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --batch_size 32
```

Note that it is recommended to substitute the `python` command by `torchrun --nproc-per-node=<number of devices> --no-python` to facilitate loading the model into the GPUs. This is especially important for large checkpoints loaded into multiple GPUs.

Not supported yet: multi-node evaluation and combinations of data replication with tensor or pipeline parallelism.

#### Multi-GPU evaluation with OpenVINO models

Pipeline parallelism during evaluation is supported with OpenVINO models

To enable pipeline parallelism, set the `model_args` of `pipeline_parallel`. In addition, you also have to set up `device` to value `HETERO:<GPU index1>,<GPU index2>` for example `HETERO:GPU.1,GPU.0` For example, the command to use pipeline parallelism of 2 is:

```bash
lm_eval --model openvino \
    --tasks wikitext \
    --model_args pretrained=<path_to_ov_model>,pipeline_parallel=True \
    --device HETERO:GPU.1,GPU.0
```

### Tensor + Data Parallel and Optimized Inference with `vLLM`

We also support vLLM for faster inference on [supported model types](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html), especially faster when splitting a model across multiple GPUs. For single-GPU or multi-GPU — tensor parallel, data parallel, or a combination of both — inference, for example:

```bash
lm_eval --model vllm \
    --model_args pretrained={model_name},tensor_parallel_size={GPUs_per_model},dtype=auto,gpu_memory_utilization=0.8,data_parallel_size={model_replicas} \
    --tasks lambada_openai \
    --batch_size auto
```

To use vllm, do `pip install lm_eval[vllm]`. For a full list of supported vLLM configurations, please reference our [vLLM integration](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/e74ec966556253fbe3d8ecba9de675c77c075bce/lm_eval/models/vllm_causallms.py) and the vLLM documentation.

vLLM occasionally differs in output from Huggingface. We treat Huggingface as the reference implementation, and provide a [script](./scripts/model_comparator.py) for checking the validity of vllm results against HF.

> [!Tip]
> For fastest performance, we recommend using `--batch_size auto` for vLLM whenever possible, to leverage its continuous batching functionality!

> [!Tip]
> Passing `max_model_len=4096` or some other reasonable default to vLLM through model args may cause speedups or prevent out-of-memory errors when trying to use auto batch size, such as for Mistral-7B-v0.1 which defaults to a maximum length of 32k.

### Tensor + Data Parallel and Fast Offline Batching Inference with `SGLang`

We support SGLang for efficient offline batch inference. Its **[Fast Backend Runtime](https://docs.sglang.ai/index.html)** delivers high performance through optimized memory management and parallel processing techniques. Key features include tensor parallelism, continuous batching, and support for various quantization methods (FP8/INT4/AWQ/GPTQ).

To use SGLang as the evaluation backend, please **install it in advance** via SGLang documents [here](https://docs.sglang.ai/start/install.html#install-sglang).

> [!Tip]
> Due to the installing method of [`Flashinfer`](https://docs.flashinfer.ai/)-- a fast attention kernel library, we don't include the dependencies of `SGLang` within [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml). Note that the `Flashinfer` also has some requirements on `torch` version.

SGLang's server arguments are slightly different from other backends, see [here](https://docs.sglang.ai/backend/server_arguments.html) for more information. We provide an example of the usage here:

```bash
lm_eval --model sglang \
    --model_args pretrained={model_name},dp_size={data_parallel_size},tp_size={tensor_parallel_size},dtype=auto \
    --tasks gsm8k_cot \
    --batch_size auto
```

> [!Tip]
> When encountering out of memory (OOM) errors (especially for multiple-choice tasks), try these solutions:
>
> 1. Use a manual `batch_size`, rather than `auto`.
> 2. Lower KV cache pool memory usage by adjusting `mem_fraction_static` - Add to your model arguments for example `--model_args pretrained=...,mem_fraction_static=0.7`.
> 3. Increase tensor parallel size `tp_size` (if using multiple GPUs).

### Model APIs and Inference Servers

Our library also supports the evaluation of models served via several commercial APIs, and we hope to implement support for the most commonly used performant local/self-hosted inference servers.

To call a hosted model, use:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
lm_eval --model openai-completions \
    --model_args model=davinci \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag
```

We also support using your own local inference server with servers that mirror the OpenAI Completions and ChatCompletions APIs.

```bash
lm_eval --model local-completions --tasks gsm8k --model_args model=facebook/opt-125m,base_url=http://{yourip}:8000/v1/completions,num_concurrent=1,max_retries=3,tokenized_requests=False,batch_size=16
```

Note that for externally hosted models, configs such as `--device` which relate to where to place a local model should not be used and do not function. Just like you can use `--model_args` to pass arbitrary arguments to the model constructor for local models, you can use it to pass arbitrary arguments to the model API for hosted models. See the documentation of the hosting service for information on what arguments they support.

Models which do not supply logits or logprobs can be used with tasks of type `generate_until` only, while local models, or APIs that supply logprobs/logits of their prompts, can be run on all task types: `generate_until`, `loglikelihood`, `loglikelihood_rolling`, and `multiple_choice`.

For more information on the different task `output_types` and model request types, see [our documentation](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/model_guide.md#interface).

> [!Note]
> For best performance with closed chat model APIs such as Anthropic Claude 3 and GPT-4, we recommend carefully looking at a few sample outputs using `--limit 10` first to confirm answer extraction and scoring on generative tasks is performing as expected. providing `system="<some system prompt here>"` within `--model_args` for anthropic-chat-completions, to instruct the model what format to respond in, may be useful.

### Other Frameworks

A number of other libraries contain scripts for calling the eval harness through their library. These include [GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/blob/main/eval_tasks/eval_adapter.py), [Megatron-DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/Megatron-DeepSpeed/blob/main/examples/MoE/readme_evalharness.md), and [mesh-transformer-jax](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/blob/master/eval_harness.py).

To create your own custom integration you can follow instructions from [this tutorial](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/interface.md#external-library-usage).

### Additional Features

> [!Note]
> For tasks unsuitable for direct evaluation — either due risks associated with executing untrusted code or complexities in the evaluation process — the `--predict_only` flag is available to obtain decoded generations for post-hoc evaluation.

If you have a Metal compatible Mac, you can run the eval harness using the MPS back-end by replacing `--device cuda:0` with `--device mps` (requires PyTorch version 2.1 or higher). **Note that the PyTorch MPS backend is still in early stages of development, so correctness issues or unsupported operations may exist. If you observe oddities in model performance on the MPS back-end, we recommend first checking that a forward pass of your model on `--device cpu` and `--device mps` match.**

> [!Note]
> You can inspect what the LM inputs look like by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> python write_out.py \
>     --tasks <task1,task2,...> \
>     --num_fewshot 5 \
>     --num_examples 10 \
>     --output_base_path /path/to/output/folder
> ```
>
> This will write out one text file for each task.

To verify the data integrity of the tasks you're performing in addition to running the tasks themselves, you can use the `--check_integrity` flag:

```bash
lm_eval --model openai \
    --model_args engine=davinci \
    --tasks lambada_openai,hellaswag \
    --check_integrity
```

## Advanced Usage Tips

For models loaded with the HuggingFace  `transformers` library, any arguments provided via `--model_args` get passed to the relevant constructor directly. This means that anything you can do with `AutoModel` can be done with our library. For example, you can pass a local path via `pretrained=` or use models finetuned with [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) by taking the call you would run to evaluate the base model and add `,peft=PATH` to the `model_args` argument:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b,parallelize=True,load_in_4bit=True,peft=nomic-ai/gpt4all-j-lora \
    --tasks openbookqa,arc_easy,winogrande,hellaswag,arc_challenge,piqa,boolq \
    --device cuda:0
```

Models provided as delta weights can be easily loaded using the Hugging Face transformers library. Within --model_args, set the delta argument to specify the delta weights, and use the pretrained argument to designate the relative base model to which they will be applied:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=Ejafa/llama_7B,delta=lmsys/vicuna-7b-delta-v1.1 \
    --tasks hellaswag
```

GPTQ quantized models can be loaded using [GPTQModel](https://github.com/ModelCloud/GPTQModel) (faster) or [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ)

GPTQModel: add `,gptqmodel=True` to `model_args`

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=model-name-or-path,gptqmodel=True \
    --tasks hellaswag
```

AutoGPTQ: add `,autogptq=True` to `model_args`:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=model-name-or-path,autogptq=model.safetensors,gptq_use_triton=True \
    --tasks hellaswag
```

We support wildcards in task names, for example you can run all of the machine-translated lambada tasks via `--task lambada_openai_mt_*`.

## Saving & Caching Results

To save evaluation results provide an `--output_path`. We also support logging model responses with the `--log_samples` flag for post-hoc analysis.

> [!TIP]
> Use `--use_cache <DIR>` to cache evaluation results and skip previously evaluated samples when resuming runs of the same (model, task) pairs. Note that caching is rank-dependent, so restart with the same GPU count if interrupted. You can also use --cache_requests to save dataset preprocessing steps for faster evaluation resumption.

To push results and samples to the Hugging Face Hub, first ensure an access token with write access is set in the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable. Then, use the `--hf_hub_log_args` flag to specify the organization, repository name, repository visibility, and whether to push results and samples to the Hub - [example dataset on the  HF Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KonradSzafer/lm-eval-results-demo). For instance:

```bash
lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=model-name-or-path,autogptq=model.safetensors,gptq_use_triton=True \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --log_samples \
    --output_path results \
    --hf_hub_log_args hub_results_org=EleutherAI,hub_repo_name=lm-eval-results,push_results_to_hub=True,push_samples_to_hub=True,public_repo=False \
```

This allows you to easily download the results and samples from the Hub, using:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

load_dataset("EleutherAI/lm-eval-results-private", "hellaswag", "latest")
```

For a full list of supported arguments, check out the [interface](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/interface.md) guide in our documentation!

## Visualizing Results

You can seamlessly visualize and analyze the results of your evaluation harness runs using both Weights & Biases (W&B) and Zeno.

### Zeno

You can use [Zeno](https://zenoml.com) to visualize the results of your eval harness runs.

First, head to [hub.zenoml.com](https://hub.zenoml.com) to create an account and get an API key [on your account page](https://hub.zenoml.com/account).
Add this key as an environment variable:

```bash
export ZENO_API_KEY=[your api key]
```

You'll also need to install the `lm_eval[zeno]` package extra.

To visualize the results, run the eval harness with the `log_samples` and `output_path` flags.
We expect `output_path` to contain multiple folders that represent individual model names.
You can thus run your evaluation on any number of tasks and models and upload all of the results as projects on Zeno.

```bash
lm_eval \
    --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8 \
    --log_samples \
    --output_path output/gpt-j-6B
```

Then, you can upload the resulting data using the `zeno_visualize` script:

```bash
python scripts/zeno_visualize.py \
    --data_path output \
    --project_name "Eleuther Project"
```

This will use all subfolders in `data_path` as different models and upload all tasks within these model folders to Zeno.
If you run the eval harness on multiple tasks, the `project_name` will be used as a prefix and one project will be created per task.

You can find an example of this workflow in [examples/visualize-zeno.ipynb](examples/visualize-zeno.ipynb).

### Weights and Biases

With the [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) integration, you can now spend more time extracting deeper insights into your evaluation results. The integration is designed to streamline the process of logging and visualizing experiment results using the Weights & Biases (W&B) platform.

The integration provide functionalities

- to automatically log the evaluation results,
- log the samples as W&B Tables for easy visualization,
- log the `results.json` file as an artifact for version control,
- log the `<task_name>_eval_samples.json` file if the samples are logged,
- generate a comprehensive report for analysis and visualization with all the important metric,
- log task and cli specific configs,
- and more out of the box like the command used to run the evaluation, GPU/CPU counts, timestamp, etc.

First you'll need to install the lm_eval[wandb] package extra. Do `pip install lm_eval[wandb]`.

Authenticate your machine with an your unique W&B token. Visit https://wandb.ai/authorize to get one. Do `wandb login` in your command line terminal.

Run eval harness as usual with a `wandb_args` flag. Use this flag to provide arguments for initializing a wandb run ([wandb.init](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/init)) as comma separated string arguments.

```bash
lm_eval \
    --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=microsoft/phi-2,trust_remote_code=True \
    --tasks hellaswag,mmlu_abstract_algebra \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8 \
    --output_path output/phi-2 \
    --limit 10 \
    --wandb_args project=lm-eval-harness-integration \
    --log_samples
```

In the stdout, you will find the link to the W&B run page as well as link to the generated report. You can find an example of this workflow in [examples/visualize-wandb.ipynb](examples/visualize-wandb.ipynb), and an example of how to integrate it beyond the CLI.

## How to Contribute or Learn More?

For more information on the library and how everything fits together, check out all of our [documentation pages](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/docs)! We plan to post a larger roadmap of desired + planned library improvements soon, with more information on how contributors can help.

### Implementing new tasks

To implement a new task in the eval harness, see [this guide](./docs/new_task_guide.md).

In general, we follow this priority list for addressing concerns about prompting and other eval details:

1. If there is widespread agreement among people who train LLMs, use the agreed upon procedure.
2. If there is a clear and unambiguous official implementation, use that procedure.
3. If there is widespread agreement among people who evaluate LLMs, use the agreed upon procedure.
4. If there are multiple common implementations but not universal or widespread agreement, use our preferred option among the common implementations. As before, prioritize choosing from among the implementations found in LLM training papers.

These are guidelines and not rules, and can be overruled in special circumstances.

We try to prioritize agreement with the procedures used by other groups to decrease the harm when people inevitably compare runs across different papers despite our discouragement of the practice. Historically, we also prioritized the implementation from [Language Models are Few Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) as our original goal was specifically to compare results with that paper.

### Support

The best way to get support is to open an issue on this repo or join the [EleutherAI Discord server](https://discord.gg/eleutherai). The `#lm-thunderdome` channel is dedicated to developing this project and the `#release-discussion` channel is for receiving support for our releases. If you've used the library and have had a positive (or negative) experience, we'd love to hear from you!
