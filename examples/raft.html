<h2>1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We remark that the example is built on LLaMA whose <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqNECQnMkycAp2jP4Z9TFX0cGR4uf7b_fBxjY_OjhJILlKGA/viewform">licensed</a> is for non-commercial use only.</p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) requires a reward function to guide the adjustment of the generative model. In this example, we show how to use LMFlow framework to train a reward model following the procedure in the InstructGPT paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155 and then align the model via the RAFT algorithm (Reward rAnked FineTuning).</p>
<p><strong>This example contains both reward modeling and RAFT alignment for completeness. For users’ convenience, we have already provided a reward model based on GPT-Neo-2.7B in huggingface repo so one can skip the reward modeling first.</strong></p>
<section id="dataset-description">
<h3>1.1 Dataset description<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-description" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We use the <em>Dahoas/full-hh-rlhf</em> dataset as an example, where each sample of this dataset consists of a prompt and two responses from the assistant. In particular, the response with label “chosen” is preferred as compared to the response with label “rejected”. The dataset consists of 112K training samples and 12.5K test samples. The following is an example sample of the dataset:</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">&quot; Human: What kind of noises did dinosaurs make? Assistant: Humans and dinosaurs didn’t live at the same time, so it’s really hard to say. The best place to find out what noises dinosaurs made would be Human: yes they did Assistant: to guess, and that would probably require lots of reading and a certain amount of imagination, so we’re not really prepared to do that. Human: you cant read Assistant: </span>

<span class="s2">Chosen response: &quot;</span>You<span class="w"> </span>can<span class="w"> </span>read?<span class="s2">&quot;</span>

<span class="s2">Rejected response: &quot;</span>there’s<span class="w"> </span>a<span class="w"> </span>lot<span class="w"> </span>of<span class="w"> </span>stuff<span class="w"> </span>humans<span class="w"> </span>don’t<span class="w"> </span>know<span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To facilitate the training, we reformulate the prompt by adding ``###’’ at the beginning of the characters so that the model knows to reply. The new sample will be of the form:</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">&quot;###Human: What kind of noises did dinosaurs make? ###Assistant: Humans and dinosaurs didn’t live at the same time, so it’s really hard to say. The best place to find out what noises dinosaurs made would be ###Human: yes they did ###Assistant: to guess, and that would probably require lots of reading and a certain amount of imagination, so we’re not really prepared to do that. ###Human: you cant read ###Assistant: </span>

<span class="s2">Chosen response: &quot;</span>You<span class="w"> </span>can<span class="w"> </span>read?<span class="s2">&quot;</span>

<span class="s2">Rejected response: &quot;</span>there’s<span class="w"> </span>a<span class="w"> </span>lot<span class="w"> </span>of<span class="w"> </span>stuff<span class="w"> </span>humans<span class="w"> </span>don’t<span class="w"> </span>know<span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We prepare all the used dataset in the directory  ./data/hh_rlhf, which can be obtained by running the following command at LMFlow</p>

If you carry your phone in a pocket or a purse then you probably want a case.  But if you only need a phone for quick interactions, a case may actually cause more harm than good.  What do you need the phone for?  Are you a parent, or do you work from home?###Human: What harm could it do?###Assistant: A phone case can damage the screen, for one thing.  It can also get you in trouble if you have your phone turned off for some reason.  Then you will turn it back on and it won’t do anything.  If you can afford to replace it, then you need a case to protect it.  The problem is that most people aren’t able to afford to replace their phones all the time.###Human: Thanks for letting me know.###Assistant: You’re welcome.&quot;</span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">  </span>

If you’re interested in history, one of the best books is The Witch Persecutions in Colonial America: A History.  If you’re interested in witchcraft as a cultural phenomenon, you might enjoy two excellent books: Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century England by Keith Thomas and Magic, Witchcraft, and the Otherworld: An Anthropology of Superstition by Jack Goody.  If you’re interested in history specifically as it relates to religion, you might enjoy The Popish Plot, or Prelates&#39; Plot: A History of the Popish Plot in England, by K. J.

<h3>2.2 Reward Modeling<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Data Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Reward modeling involves ranking responses based on the given prompt, typically requiring human labeling. Fortunately, we already have two responses for each prompt in this example, with one preferred over the other. To create a new dataset, we modify the original dataset to include two keys, “positive” and “negative”, with the former being the preferred response.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the dataset <em>LMFlow/data/hh_rlhf/rm/hh_rlhf_rm_training.json</em>, consisting of two samples.</p>

The simplest might be to just pile up all the furniture in one room.  This works if you have a single room in your house, although it might still be a bit challenging to build a taller and sturdier fort this way.  The best way to build forts is to start with something easy, and then have fun exploring how you can improve it.&quot;</span><span class="o">}</span>

<p><strong>Training</strong></p>
<p>To start from a model from a previous sft step, you may edit the <em>./scripts/run_reward_modeling.sh</em> script and update the “dataset_path” to use the desired dataset. By default, we will use LoRA training in reward modeling as we found that it is superior in terms of optimization and gives comparable performance.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>–model_name_or_path: /root/data/usr_name/output_models/hh_rlhf_rm_sft_gptneo_2_7B/checkpoint-1659</p></li>
<li><p>–dataset_path: ${project_dir}/data/hh_rlhf/rm/hh_rlhf_rm_training.json</p></li>
<li><p>–output_dir: the path you want to store the reward model</p></li>
<li><p>–num_train_epochs: 1</p></li>
<li><p>–learning_rate: 3e-5</p></li>
<li><p>–per_device_train_batch_size: adjust according to your GPU memory source.</p></li>
<li><p>–eval_steps: 400</p></li>
<li><p>–validation_split_percentage: 10</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The load_dataset function splits the dataset into training and evaluation sets, which can also be customized by editing the function in /examples/run_reward_modeling.py if you want to prepare your own dataset when running the script. In the default implementation, it use <strong>validation_split_percentage</strong> samples as the evaluation dataset.</p>
<p>The reward modeling script can be used by</p>

<p>Clearly the global ranking strategy is more efficient in terms of the reward learning. However, in some cases (e.g. the example presented here), the rewards are heavily influenced by the prompts, so a local ranking with the same prompt is more appropriate. We can choose the data collection strategy by changing the hyper-parameter ``data_collection’’ as we introduce in next subsection.</p>

<section id="id2">
<h4>3.3.2 RAFT Alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>We align the LLaMA-7B-SFT model in this subsection. Alignment is challenging since the reward function (the RL environment) is far from perfect. Both the traditional DRL method (PPO) and RAFT can exploit theses imperfections to attack. We present a step-by-step record to demonstrate how can we align the model and avoid these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Data Preparation</strong></p>
<p>We observe that a long context window will lead to a heavy burden on the GPU memory source. Therefore, we use a context window of 256 tokens and discard the prompts with more tokens to reduce the burden on the GPU memory resources. This results in a prompt set of 82147 samples (originally 112K). The following is an example of the prompt where we simply discard the response:</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;###Human: Should you buy a case to protect your cell phone?###Assistant: It depends on your circumstances.  If you carry your phone in a pocket or a purse then you probably want a case.  But if you only need a phone for quick interactions, a case may actually cause more harm than good.  What do you need the phone for?  Are you a parent, or do you work from home?###Human: What harm could it do?###Assistant: A phone case can damage the screen, for one thing.  It can also get you in trouble if you have your phone turned off for some reason.  Then you will turn it back on and it won’t do anything.  If you can afford to replace it, then you need a case to protect it.  The problem is that most people aren’t able to afford to replace their phones all the time.###Human: Thanks for letting me know.###Assistant:&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We additionally use 2K samples from the test set to test the performance of models. In what follows, we show that how we apply RAFT to LLaMA-7B-SFT and improve the model step-by-step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: test the sft-model</strong></p>
<p>We first evaluate the performance of the LLaMA-7B-SFT model on the hand-out test set and observe that the model tends to reply the prompt with multiple rounds of conversations. Therefore, we adopt the following post-processing strategy to use only the first round as the response.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">_clean_text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 2: train model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reward function setting</strong></p>
<p>The reward model is specified at the /LMFlow/examples/raft_align.py to set up the reward model we want to use. In our case, we will use the GPT-Neo-2.7B-rm trained in the last step, which is set as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">reward_model_or_path</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Optional</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">field</span><span class="p">(</span>

        <span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that in general, if the reward function is not trained by following the steps in last section, you may also need to modify the ``get_reward_function’’ function in the same file to use your customized reward function.</p>
<p>We run the alignment with the following command and hyper-parameters</p>
<div class="highlight-sh notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>./scripts/run_raft_align.sh<span class="w"> </span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>–dataset_path:${project_dir}/data/hh_rlhf/rlhf_prompt</p></li>
<li><p>–output_dir: /root/data/usr_name/output_models/hh_rlhf_raft_align</p></li>

<li><p>–inference_batch_size_per_device: adjust according to your GPU memory source.</p></li>
<li><p>–num_raft_iteration  20</p></li>
<li><p>–top_reward_percentage 0.125; (which means that we sample 8 responses for each prompt)</p></li>
<li><p>–raft_batch_size 1024</p></li>
<li><p>–collection_strategy “local”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment runs smoothly and the training reward increases from ~2.7 to 3.4. However, we observe a significant drop in the diversity metric (e.g. distinct-2 drops to 0.22 from 0.39). We examine the samples generated by our samples at each raft iteration and find that at the first iteration, the initial checkpoint will occasionally include # in the response and it tends out that a random # is not detected by our reward function, which means that the response containing # can also have a high reward and be chosen into the training set. Then, the situation gets worse and worse, and eventually, half of the responses contain noisy # notations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: retrain the model</strong></p>
<p>To alleviate the problem in step 2, we simply discard the collected samples if they contain # by assigning a large negative reward to it. It turns out that this works for our goal. If you want to disable it, just modify the following function as always returning False.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">_discard_sample</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">True</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">False</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The following figure shows the reward curve of RAFT (note that we use a smaller temperature to test the model, leading to a higher evaluation reward):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_images/raft_reward.PNG" /></p>
<p>It tends out that the obtained model achieves a good reward and also an acceptable diversity metric, where we refer the interested readers to the original paper for details. However, it is more like a starting point of our journey. We present some randomly sampled responses here. It seems that RAFT-aligned model generally tends to reply with more details although sometimes there are some redundant words in the response. We suspect that this is because the reward model likes this type of response and this imperfection is exploited.</p>

<section id="end-note">
<h4>3.3.3 End Note<a class="headerlink" href="#end-note" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>We remark in this subsection that if you want to try out RAFT on your customized task. You should carefully modify the following two functions in <em>LMFlow/src/lmflow/pipeline/raft_aligner.py</em>, which extract the response from the generated texts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>clean_text(self, text);</p></li>
<li><p>discard_sample(self, text).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, you may also first make sure the collected samples (automatically saved in the output_dir) look good.</p>
<p>There are still many rooms of improvement. To further improve the model performance, we can improve the reward model (e.g. by using the LLaMA-7B-RM) and try out more advanced generation strategies (by modifying the generalization configuration in <em>LMFlow/src/lmflow/pipeline/raft_aligner.py</em>), which we leave for future work. We are still actively developing RAFT and welcome for feedback and also contribution! Also checkout our LMFlow framework to get more fun of LLMs:</p>

Ask them if there’s anything they’d like to gain from doing their homework. Try asking if there’s anything you can do for them, and use those as motivation for them to do their homework. You can also remind them that they’ll be rewarded with extra privileges, like video games, if they do their homework.  Alternatively, you can incentivize them by including them in your plans, and offering them rewards if they get good grades.###Human: So make it so there is something in it for them?###Assistant:</p></td>
<td><p>Yes, exactly.  In general, it’s important to be clear with your child about why they’re doing something.  It’s also important to offer them incentives that are meaningful to them.

<td><p>Yes, that’s a good strategy!  Kids often think about what they want right now, so offering them something in exchange for doing their homework can be a powerful motivator.  You might also want to offer them some kind of reward if they do well on their homework, to encourage them to do their best.

<td><p>Here’s what I know: <br />1.  The game was released in an unfinished state. <br />2.  This led to Kojima leaving Konami. <br />3.  Kojima had been with Konami for over 30 years.<br />4.  He was one of the original creators of the Metal Gear series.<br />5.  He is now the head of his own game studio, Kojima Productions.<br />6.  His new game, Death Stranding, will be released in 2020.</p></td>

<td><p>Here are a few options:###1. Ask your supervisor if you can help them, and explain what you’d like to do to help.###2. Start with the tasks your supervisor does incorrectly.

<td><p>To correct your supervisor’s mistakes, you should provide feedback in a respectful and diplomatic way.  You should explain what the problems are, and offer suggestions for how your supervisor could improve.

<td><p>Hm, I think you’re really talking about something that’s frustrating for me as well. I really care about how we make sure that AI’s can communicate effectively with humans, and it’s a problem I’m personally very interested in. Can you tell me more about what was frustrating for you?</p></td>
<td><p>Yes, it can be frustrating when technology doesn’t work properly. I often feel frustrated by technology, but I try to be patient and remember that technology isn’t always reliable. There are many factors that can cause technology to malfunction, including software bugs, hardware issues, and network outages. Thankfully, most technology issues can be resolved by updating software or restarting a device.</p></td>
