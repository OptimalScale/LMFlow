# LMFlow

We welcome contributions from the open-source community with open arms! We value and appreciate all types of participation, not just code. Whether you're answering questions, offering help, improving the documentation, or simply reaching out, your contributions are immensely valuable to us. So, if you're interested, don't hesitate to get involved!

To start, we encourage everyone to say hello in our public Discord channel. Here, we discuss the latest trends in Large Foundation models, showcase personal projects, help each other with contributions, or just hang out over a cup of coffee. Join us on Discord!

No matter how you choose to contribute, we strive to maintain an open, welcoming, and kind community. We ask that you read our code of conduct and be respectful during your interactions. It's also essential that you become familiar with the ethical guidelines that guide our project and adhere to the same principles of transparency and responsibility.

We highly value feedback from the community, so please don't hesitate to speak up if you have any valuable feedback that can help improve the library. We read and consider every message, comment, issue, and pull request (PR).
