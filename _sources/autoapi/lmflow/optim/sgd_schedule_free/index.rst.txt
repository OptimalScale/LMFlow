   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.optim.Optimizer`


   
   Schedule-Free SGD
   As the name suggests, no scheduler is needed with this optimizer. 
   To add warmup, rather than using a learning rate schedule you can just
   set the warmup_steps parameter.

   This optimizer requires that .train() and .eval() be called before the
   beginning of training and evaluation respectively. The optimizer should
   also be placed in eval mode when saving checkpoints.

   .. py:method:: eval()


   .. py:method:: train()


   .. py:method:: step(closure=None)

      
      Performs a single optimization step.

      Arguments:
          closure (callable, optional): A closure that reevaluates the model
              and returns the loss.
